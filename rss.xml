            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The excellent Accidental Tech Podcast has launched <a href="https://atp.fm/join">a membership program</a>. For $8/Month you can get access to their ad-free feed (and likely more to come!). While it seems a tad on the high end on first place, keep it mind that you’re getting roughly audiobook-length (8-ish hours) podcasts per month. They’re also making a very good show too!</p><p>The irony of this is, that of all the podcasts I listen to ATP is somewhere at the top of having enjoyable ads. They have <em>generally</em> good and interesting sponsors, the ad reads are fun and non-intrusive (unlike these super annoying dynamically inserted ones). ATP also has a very good ad-to-content ratio.</p><p>Even better, most of the podcasts I listen to which have more annoying ad reads either don’t provide an ad-free feed at all (if there’s a Patreon or similar it usually just provides extra content and other stuff) or are not made well enough for me to support them (show notes not being filled in, etc).</p><p>I suggest to go ahead and support ATP in their decision!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Apple plans to announce ARM transition for all Macs at WWDC 2020</title>
            <description>Rumor about Apple announcing custom ARM chips for their Mac lineup are manifesting again</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First of all: WWDC is in two weeks, so we’ll then see if that’s true or not. Rumors about Apple transitioning to ARM have been going on for a while now.</p><p>I personally would <em>love</em> a well done transition. But only if it includes support for AMD64 for a few more years. They <em>just</em> dropped support for 32-bit Applications in Catalina, so I guess they’re not completely dropping AMD64 soon. Their past processor architecture transitions have been pretty smooth, so I have some faith.</p><p>Apple has been unhappy with their Intel chips for a while now, and I think that hey haven’t switched to AMD yet is a sign that they’re actually working in custom Mac chips.</p><p>I will be staying clear of the first generation ones, but my current Laptop is due to being replaced during the next 2-3 years. I hope all major issues have died until then.</p><p>Dave Mark, writing for The Loop has posted a <a href="https://www.loopinsight.com/2020/06/10/a-few-good-reads-and-one-video-on-apple-and-arm-based-macs/">very good list</a>, collecting the thoughts of John Gruber, David Shayer, and Dieter Bohn</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I find Saturns Hexagon super interesting. The amount of guesswork is pretty high in this paper:</p><blockquote><p>We have limited data about anything but the uppermost layers of Saturn’s atmosphere, and there are lots of physical properties that could be tweaked in search of a perfect match. But for now, this study presents one possible configuration of the model, described as a “proof of concept.”</p></blockquote><p>But nonetheless, I’m happy to see that they’re working on it and started making theories. I hope that with more time they’ll get more accurate data</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Instagram just threw users of its embedding API under the bus</title>
            <description>Instagrams declares that users embedding their content don't have the license to embed other people's content</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, Instagram provides an API to embed posts on it. They also have a license to all their users photos. They specifically even gave themselves the rights to sub-license these to other users. Yet, they <em>don't</em> actually grant the rights to those embedding their posts.</p><p>This is <em>precisely</em> why we need an open Internet. The current social media platforms all do their best to keep users within their own ecosystem, without access from outside. Ever tried to follow a Facebook page without an account? Or a Twitter user? Or someone Instagram? The tech exists. RSS would do fine for these (in fact, I’m using <a href="https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge">RSS Bridge</a> to do exactly that), but more modern alternatives exist such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a>.</p><p>Both Twitter and Reddit are also closing down on their API, allowing certain features to be accessed only from their official client. Despite much better and more polished ones existing for both. Facebook has done so a long time ago already. You used to be able to do all sorts of fun shenanigans with it. Tom Scott has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxV14h0kFs0">a fantastic video about that</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The physics kind of hologram, not the Star Trek kind. Sorry!</p><p>I generally find physics super interesting, even though I barely understand any of it. To be fair, I'm not alone, a lot more in modern physics is an enormous question mark than most people realize. We basically <a href="http://phdcomics.com/noidea/">have no idea</a> what's going on.</p><p>Quantum gravity is a complex beast; gravity turns out to be super weird in all sorts of ways and we (that is, man very very smart people) haven't figured out yet how to combine quantum theory and gravity.</p><p>This new paper is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle">holographic principle</a> (no, not the <a href="https://album.link/en/i/1458752909">Epica Album</a> although it's pretty good. Go listen to it!) and therefore based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory">String Theory</a>. That's super deep into "no fucking clue" territory.</p><p>Anyways, I still think it's a cool idea!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cory Doctorow is talking on his excellent Pluralistic blog about the collapse of AMC, and the monopolies involved in it.</p><blockquote><p>What's more, AMC took advantage of America's nonexistent antitrust law to buy most of its competitors, making it the only screen in town for many of America's cities.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>AMC's demise matters, then, because it constitutes the bulk of American screens.</p></blockquote><p>This is going to be interesting how the movie industry is going to look like in a year or two. AMC is dying, and Disney now has Disney+ and <em>could</em> just release the bulk of it's movies there. "Trolls World Tour" was a raging success and "Artemis Fowl" is going to be released exclusively on Disney+ too.</p><p>However, Time-Warner are cutting into Disney's profit (not that Disney isn't still making truckloads of money though) there:</p><blockquote><p>So Disney needs big screens, especially since its Plan B, streaming media through Disney+, is being demolished by Time-Warner/AT&T;, which is using Trump FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's obliteration of Net Neutrality to upcharge customers who choose Disney+ over HBO Max.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If nothing else, it's a good read. Go and check it out!</p><p>I certainly understand that Apple wants to prevent spamming on their platform, but I love automating stuff, so I find it's quite a shame. On one hand I'd like to have an official iMesage app on Windows (I do own a Windows machine after all), on the other hand... have you <em>seen</em> their Windows software? iTunes is even worse than its macOS counterpart was (and honestly, "Music" is still crap), and iCloud is basically non-functional for me. <em>If</em> it works it's slow, but usually it just doesn't work at all.</p>]]></content:encoded>
