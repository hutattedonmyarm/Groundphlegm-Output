            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cory Doctorow is talking on his excellent Pluralistic blog about the collapse of AMC, and the monopolies involved in it.</p><blockquote><p>What's more, AMC took advantage of America's nonexistent antitrust law to buy most of its competitors, making it the only screen in town for many of America's cities.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>AMC's demise matters, then, because it constitutes the bulk of American screens.</p></blockquote><p>This is going to be interesting how the movie industry is going to look like in a year or two. AMC is dying, and Disney now has Disney+ and <em>could</em> just release the bulk of it's movies there. "Trolls World Tour" was a raging success and "Artemis Fowl" is going to be released exclusively on Disney+ too.</p><p>However, Time-Warner are cutting into Disney's profit (not that Disney isn't still making truckloads of money though) there:</p><blockquote><p>So Disney needs big screens, especially since its Plan B, streaming media through Disney+, is being demolished by Time-Warner/AT&T;, which is using Trump FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's obliteration of Net Neutrality to upcharge customers who choose Disney+ over HBO Max.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If nothing else, it's a good read. Go and check it out!</p><p>I certainly understand that Apple wants to prevent spamming on their platform, but I love automating stuff, so I find it's quite a shame. On one hand I'd like to have an official iMesage app on Windows (I do own a Windows machine after all), on the other hand... have you <em>seen</em> their Windows software? iTunes is even worse than its macOS counterpart was (and honestly, "Music" is still crap), and iCloud is basically non-functional for me. <em>If</em> it works it's slow, but usually it just doesn't work at all.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Initially I wanted to go towards the linklog style of content, mostly because "oh, look what I found" and a comment about it is what I do <em>anyways</em>, but obviously the first entry (and this one too!) had to be different. Whoops.</p><p>I didn't even have a decent way yet to do it the way I want (by turning the blog titles into a link to the original), but I just implemented that. There's still some things missing, it sort of works now!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, this is it. The basics are up, but I'm sure I'll be fiddling with it for a bit. Xcode's syntax highlighting for markdown is quite... <a href="https://groundphlegm.wedro.online//images/xcode-syntax-highlight.png">interesting</a>!.</p><a href="https://groundphlegm.wedro.online//images/xcode-syntax-highlight.png"><img src="https://groundphlegm.wedro.online//images/xcode-syntax-highlight.png" alt="Xcode Markdown Syntac Highligter"></a><p>For whatever reason it seems to think of it as a Swift file. Restarting it helped, so I can live with it</p>]]></content:encoded>
