            <description>Unsurprisingly, exclusives hurt the industry, and that extends to audiobooks too</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently switched from Audible to <a href="https://libro.fm">libro.fm</a>, and I was pretty shocked at how many titles are exclusive to Audible. Other than that, I do like it, except some minor issues. (I can't open a membership from Germany, but I can <em>gift</em> one, so I just gifted myself one; and they haven't added any German publishers yet, but are working on it)</p><p>With the usual issues surrounding exclusives, Audible has two main extra problems:</p><ul><li><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/08/attack-surface-kickstarter/#asks">Audible will not carry any audiobooks unless they have DRM</a></li><li>Libraries, bookstores, schools, and anyone who isn’t affiliated with Amazon cannot distribute audiobooks that are Audible Exclusives.</li></ul><p>Yes, libraries! People, libraries are important! Both for accessibility and for getting people interested in reading. And it also hurts your favorite local bookstore.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I absolutely love the idea of smart glasses. There are some non-technical issues with them. The wearer's privacy, every one else's, and the implication that people instead of glancing at their smartphones in social situations they're now glancing at their glasses, which might interrupt and disturb these.</p><p>I also think the tech isn't quite there yet, both in terms of assistants and in terms of hardware. I'd also prefer having an image instead of just sound with these, otherwise they're just smart earbuds but without the rudeness of wearing earbuds during conversations.</p><blockquote><p>Up close, Alexa isn’t smart enough to know when you’re speaking with another human, so sometimes it interrupted with its random chirps.</p></blockquote><p>With smart watches and phones going more and more in the "always listening, waiting for a keyword" direction this will get better I think.</p><blockquote><p>My bigger technical problem has been keeping them running. The Frames battery has never really made it through the day — they conk out after three hours of constant music streaming at 60 percent volume.</p></blockquote><p>To be fair, I wouldn't <em>want</em> to use them to stream lots of music, due to their sound. So who knows how good the regular use battery life is.</p><p>All in all, I'm super curious how this sort of tech will develop within the next 5-10 years</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had been following the VR Headset market for a few years, and been in the “I’m going to buy one sooner or later” market. When Facebook bought Oculus in 2014, I continues to keep up with news about them, but clearly said I won’t be buying an Oculus headset. Because, you know, Facebook. A couple years later (that is, earlier in 2020) I acquired such a headset and completely ruled out any of their HMDs. This has turned out to be a good decision, I’m incredibly happy with the one I got and now this:</p><blockquote>
Today, we’re announcing some important updates to how people log into Oculus devices, while still keeping their VR profile. Starting in October 2020:
<ul>

<li>Everyone using an Oculus device for the first time will need to log in with a Facebook account.</li>

<li>If you’re an existing user and already have an Oculus account, you’ll have the option to log in with Facebook and merge your Oculus and Facebook accounts.</li>

<li>If you’re an existing user and choose not to merge your accounts, you can continue using your Oculus account for two years.</li>
<ul>
</blockquote><p><strong>Fucking what now?</strong> I <em>wish</em> this was surprising, but alas, I’m only surprised it has taken them so long</p>]]></content:encoded>

Removing it from the Store? Sure, go ahead. Terminating the dev account? That’s a whole new level, considering it affects macOS too and, well, the notarisation process for macOS apps is used ”for security and malware stuff only”. We are exiting “security” territory. Not. amused.</p><p>Because I’m a lazy guy, go ahead and read <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/">the stratechery post</a>, because Ben Thompson is alway worth a read</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year, we detected some unusual dimming of Betelgeuse. Now we know why:</p><blockquote><p>"With Hubble, we had previously observed hot convection cells on the surface of Betelgeuse and in the fall of 2019 we discovered a large amount of dense hot gas moving outwards through Betelgeuse's extended atmosphere. We think this gas cooled down millions of miles outside the star to form the dust that blocked the southern part of the star imaged in January and February," said Andrea Dupree, associate director of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian, and lead author on the study.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

MDN is a <em>fantastic</em> resource, but Mozilla is promising tat it’ll stick around:</p><blockquote><p>“MDN as a website isn’t going anywhere right now,” the spokesperson said in an email. “The team is smaller, but the site exists and isn’t going away. We will be working with partners and community members to find the right ways to move it forward given our new structure at Mozilla.”</p></blockquote><p>That doesn’t sound too promising if I’m honest. Oh, the site will continue to exist? And they’ll work with the community? Good riddance, I hope it will stay as good as it currently is.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a sad announcement. <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/mozilla-lays-off-250-employees-while-it-refocuses-on-commercial-products/">According to ZDNet</a> they'll lose a ton of revenue which would've been provided by Google in the future:</p><blockquote><p>Furthermore, Mozilla's contract with Google to include Google as the default search provider inside Firefox is set to expire later this year, and the contract has not been renewed. The Google deal has historically accounted for around 90% of all of Mozilla's revenue, and without it experts see a dim future for Mozilla past 2021.</p></blockquote><p>As a fan of <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> I didn't particularly <em>like</em> them havign Google as thwir default search engine, but I did accept it as a decent form of revenue for them.</p><p>I've seen a lot of criticism about how they should focus on Firefox and not all the other crap that's "nobody needs" and "only costs them personnel". As I see it, making a browser isn't exactly profitable, even if I'd love them to focus a lot on it.</p><p>Selling us cool stuff and using that to finance developing Firefox seems to me a better idea, which seems somewhat to be what they're aiming for:</p><blockquote><p>New focus on economics. Recognizing that the old model where everything was free has consequences, means we must explore a range of different business opportunities and alternate value exchanges.</p></blockquote><p>There's a bit more detail in the memo which is linked in their blog post:</p><blockquote><p>We are organizing a new product organization outside of Firefox that will both ship new products faster and develop new revenue streams. Our initial investments will be Pocket, Hubs, VPN,Web Assembly and security and privacy products.</p></blockquote><p>I'd <em>love</em> to see Pocket get some more love. I had been using it before their aquisition and was delighted to see Mozilla buying Pocket. And then they did nothing with it. The redesign is meh (the tile layout has room to display things I don't care about like "this article is super popular", but not to view my own tags) and their API exists, but is super crap. I'd be super willing to get Pocket premium, but there's not a single feature in there I'm interested in.</p><p>I sincerely hope that they'll be able to provide good value services to us in the future.</p><p>Oh, btw, they <a href="https://twitter.com/MichalPurzynski/status/1293220570885062657">killed entire threat management team</a>.That's gonna backfire.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description>Why contextual ads are not only better for the user, but also better for the site who is running them</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is about behavioural ads vs contextual ones. So what are each of them?</p><blockquote><p>The mainstay of online advertising is "behavioural advertising" in which ads are placed based on dossiers of your activity and preferences that have been compiled by Big Tech giants and shadowy data-brokers.</p></blockquote><p>In contrast to contextual ads:</p><blockquote><p>That's when publishers sell off the right to advertise to you based on the subject of the article you're reading, your location (based on your IP address) and other metadata, like which browser and OS you're using.</p></blockquote><p>So, the issue (for whoever is running the ad, not the user) is the following:</p><blockquote><p>Advertising on the Washington Post is expensive. "Washington Post reader" is a valuable category unto itself: a lot of blue-chip firms will draw up marketing plans that say, "Make sure we tell Washington Post readers about this product!"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Here's the thing: the companies want to advertise to Washington Post readers, but they don't care about advertising in the Washington Post.</p></blockquote><p>For those who <em>don’t</em> get the ad bid, they still have the info that you are a WaPo reader. Now they can advertise to WaPo readers without having to advertise there! This is obviously a problem for the WaPo, because they want to sell their ad spaces, which is harder for them if firms can target the same people for cheaper somewhere else.</p><p>So why is the WaPo (and of course other publications!) still doing that?</p><blockquote><p>Data-brokers make crazy claims for how well their targeting works in "conversions" – that is, turning ads into sales.</p></blockquote><p>Doctorow found <a href="https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_38.pdf">a paper</a>, that says contextual ads are just as effective. Plus, they’re friendlier towards the user’s privacy (and thus easier to implement under GDPR)</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>After more investigation, I found out that the distribution certificates were revoked – evidently by Apple as no one else has access to them and I was sound asleep when all this happened. […] When Apple revokes the certificate, it’s generally a remove kill-switch for the apps.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Anyway, there is (to my knowledge) no hotline for developers that you can call. As it was 7AM (all times are CET), Apple’s contact form only showed the option to send them an email – so I did. At 9AM with my teeth grinding, I went for the phone option where you leave a number and they call you back. Didn’t.</p></blockquote><p>This is the issue here. Mistakes happen.. However for something like revoking the certificate they should not only make damn sure that this is what they want to do (which clearly didn’t happen hear), but also <em>provide a good way to contact them</em></p><blockquote><p>after almost 24 hours after 10PM, I got my account re-instated</p></blockquote><p>That is too long.</p><blockquote><p>Apple has called and apologized for the complications. The issue was caused by my account being erroneously flagged by automated processes</p></blockquote><p><strong>Don’t the manually check the output of their automated process‽</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks NYT for the rather clunky title. But it <em>does</em> summarise pretty well what happened, so I’ll excuse it. In short: SpaceX launched Crew Dragon with Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley into orbit (would’ve been nice to have at least one female astronaut in there… <em>*</em>), they remained 64 days aboard the ISS, and now returned back into the blue of the blue planet.</p><p>Behnken and Hurley helped the sole Christopher J. Cassidy on it with the chores, did four space walks, operated the robot arm, and contributed to some experiments.</p><p class="footnote"><em>*</em>I get it, they’re Bob & Doug. Very good friends, both space veterans and generally a very solid choice. However it does leave a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. Also, I need to dig into how to do footnotes, Ink (the Markdown parser used by Publish) doesn’t do the <code>[^1]</code> style</p>]]></content:encoded>

Well, we got our first arrests!</p><blockquote><p>Early on July 31st, the FBI, IRS, US Secret Service, and Florida law enforcement placed [a] 17-year-old Graham […] Florida [resident], under arrest. He’s accused of being the “mastermind” behind the biggest security and privacy breach in Twitter’s history</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[…] he allegedly convinced a Twitter employee that he worked in the Twitter IT department and tricked that employee into giving him the credentials.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[…] [he] is currently in jail and being charged with over 30 felony counts, including organized fraud, communications fraud, identity theft, and hacking</p></blockquote><p>A 22-year-old hacked called “Rolex” and 19-year-old “Chaewon” were also arrested.</p><p>These two managed to ID themselves with their real driver’s licenses to Binance and Coinbase where some of the stolen Bitcoin ended up.</p><blockquote><p>[Rolex] is facing five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for one count of computer intrusion. [Chaewon] is being charged with computer intrusion, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy, the most serious of which comes with a 20-year sentence and a $250,000 fine in the US.</p></blockquote><p>Make sure to also take a look at Twitter’s <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html">blog post</a> about the incident!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yuki Morono and his team at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology dug up 100 million year old mud from the sea and fed it (Well, not the mud itself, but whatever is hanging out in there).</p><blockquote><p>They grabbed plugs of sediment up to about 70 meters below the seafloor. Very little sediment accumulates here, so that 70-meter-thick pile of clay represents about 100 million years of time.</p></blockquote><p>In case you’re wondering if it can’t just be younger bacteria in the mud, there’s an answer:</p><blockquote><p>The thing is, the researchers don’t think this is just modern bacteria that have made their way deep into the mud. In fact, they shouldn’t be able to move at all in that mud. The average space between particles in the clay should be considerably smaller than the size of a bacterium. The presence of microbes in the oldest sediments represent communities that are about as old as the sediment itself, the researchers conclude.</p></blockquote><p>But back to feeding the mud:</p><blockquote><p>The researchers took these little plugs of sediment and injected substances bacteria can use to grow, like sugar and ammonia. And sure enough, bacteria grew and gobbled them up</p></blockquote><p>In conclusion:</p><blockquote><p>So if the researchers are right about what they’ve found, it’s a testament to the fact that life is nothing if not persistent. By slowing down to live within extremely limited means, these bacterial communities may have survived for a simply incredible length of time.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been fascinated by SETI for quite a while now, so whenever I stumble over a link with info about it I tend to inhale it. Maybe, partly, because it’s so ridiculous. Who knows.</p><p>Anyways, let’s get to the sciency bits!</p><blockquote><p>You may have heard of searching for life on other planets by looking for “biosignatures”—molecules or phenomena that would only occur or persist if life were present.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To detect spectroscopic biosignatures we will need telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) or the ground-based Extremely Large Telescope, both currently under construction.</p></blockquote><p>JWST is currently facing delays (again) though. Also, do yourself a favour and check out <a href="https://www.popsci.com/craziest-names-weve-given-important-scientific-devices/">telescope names</a>, there are some nice ones! There’s (of course!) even a <a href="https://xkcd.com/1294/">relevant XKCD</a></p><blockquote><p>[…]It would be most promising to look for radio waves because they are less likely to be absorbed by planetary atmospheres and require less energy to transmit.[…]</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>What’s special about these signals is that they exhibit high degrees of coherence, meaning there is a large amount of electromagnetic energy in just one frequency or a very small instance of time—not something nature typically does.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In March 2019, Pennsylvania State University announced the new Penn State Extraterrestrial Intelligence Center (PSETI)—to be led by Wright, who is a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the school. One of just two astrobiology PhD programs in the world (the other is at UCLA), PSETI plans on hosting the first Penn State SETI Symposium in June 2021.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Some of PSETI’s main goals are to permanently fund SETI research worldwide, train the next generation of SETI practitioners, and support and foster a worldwide SETI community.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Wright often calls SETI low-hanging fruit. “This field has been starved of resources for so long that there is still a ton of work to do that could have been done decades ago,” says Wright. “We can very quickly make a lot of progress in this field without a lot of effort.”</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

I <em>know</em> it’s not easy to moderate these enormous amounts of content. But YouTube is doing such an incredibly shitty job, with videos getting demonetized for the most ridiculous of reasons, wrongful DMCA takedowns, radicalising and conspiracy rabbit holes <strong>and don’t even have a decent way for content creators to complain</strong>, that <em>something</em> needs to be done!</p>]]></content:encoded>

They current API <strong>doesn’t let you retrieve the replies to a Tweet</strong>, so showing a conversation is practically impossible. (I’m aware that there are workarounds, e.g. by using the search and then some filtering, but that’s limited by the API too), doesn’t let you access polls (not even <em>that</em> a tweet does have a poll), so it seriously limits third party apps. As a happy user of Tweetbot I very much welcome this change. I’ll just hope that they will stop bullshitting developers, Twitter burned some serious bridges there.</p>]]></content:encoded>
