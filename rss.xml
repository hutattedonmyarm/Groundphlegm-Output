            <description>Apple releases their Developer app on macOS. It’s very Catalyst.</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So Apple has finally released a macOS version of their WWDC app. Unsurprisingly, it’s based on Catalyst. I’m not a fan of Catalyst at all, I haven’t found a <em>good</em> app based on it yet. They range from crappy to barely acceptable. They usually don’t feel like a good Mac app and get the details wrong. And exactly these details are what make good Mac apps.</p><p>This WWDC app is no exception. It exists and it’s… okay. Nothing more, nothing less.</p><blockquote><p>When you select the search field in the Developer app it shows the focus ring. Unfortunately this focus ring has square corners, rather than the rounded corners seen on every other focus ring on the Mac.</p></blockquote><p>I’d call it nitpicky (and I promise, the other points are more important), but this is a good example, because it emphasised how deep the problem is and that even in the best case these apps feel just a bit off.</p><blockquote><p>There should be a UI element that is the current focus, upon which keyboard input or menu items act. This is displayed by using the system accent colour. […] Unfortunately the Developer app doesn't do this at all, leading to confusion as to where the focus currently is.</p></blockquote><p>I do most of my things with the keyboard, so current focus is <em>crucial</em> to me.</p><blockquote><p>When a table has focus on the Mac, users expect to be able to start typing in a word. The table will then jump selection to the cell who's content most closely matches the typed value. Sadly the Developer app does not support this (which seems to be another general Catalyst issue).</p></blockquote><p>This is another one of those small quality of life things which make my life as a user easier and just got forgotten about by Catalyst</p><blockquote><p>At the bottom is a button titled "See latest videos and articles". Rather than switching the sidebar navigation to the "What's New" section, it instead slides on the "What's New" list in the full content area</p></blockquote><p>Aaaaaaaah!</p><blockquote><p>Unfortunately the navigation when using something like VoiceOver is not great. […] Unfortunately everything seems to be at the top level. And I mean everything. Every view, every table cell. Even the find bar can be navigated to, even though it is off screen.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/06/17/developer-app-for-mac">Gruber summarised it very well</a></p><blockquote><p>As things stand right now, Catalyst seems like a framework written by people at Apple who don’t know what makes for a good Mac app, for iOS developers who don’t know what makes for a good Mac app.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new email service from Basecamp “Hey” <a href="https://www.protocol.com/hey-email-app-store-rejection">got an update to their app rejected</a>, because Apple can’t stop being Apple and is doing nefarious bullshit with their in-App-purchase guidelines.</p><p>Short version: “Hey” is not providing any option to signup or start a subscription from within their app (to workaround the 30% problem), the same as e.g. Netflix and Dropbox do. But because they <s>are a consumer and not a business product</s> are not as big as Netflix or Dropbox Apple is applying different rules here and are not allowing them in anyways.</p><p>Apple made up an argument about “Business vs. Customer”.</p><blockquote><p>First, no such distinction is made in the App Store Review Guidelines. The lone instance of “consumer” refers to the “Consumer Health Records API”.</p></blockquote><p>Oops. Apple is clearly on the wrong here, and they really need to sort their crap out when it comes to their review guidelines and especially in-App purchases.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The European Commission is investigating Apple for its App Store and Apple Pay.</p><blockquote><p>[…] over how Apple takes a 30 percent commission on every subscription signed up through its App Store in the first year, and then a 15 percent cut.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>At the same time, the companies complained, Apple has promoted its own music and books services. The European Commission is also looking at whether App Store rules stifle competition in gaming and cloud services, according to people with direct knowledge of the situation.</p></blockquote><p>Apple has made quite a lot of people unhappy with its stance on in-App purchases. On one hand it’s pushing them (and subscriptions), on the other hand they are exceptions from their Family Sharing program.</p><p>Forcing all payments for digital goods to go through their system is inconvenient for the user (can’t buy e.g. Kindle ebooks from within the Amazon app, have to through their website), because Apple wants their 30% cut and Amazon doesn’t want to give that cut away. <strong>Nobody</strong> wins. Apple doesn’t get their 30%, the other businesses (Netflix, Amazon, etc) are losing some of their customers (who are unwilling to switch to the website, because the app isn’t even allowed to <em>link</em> to the site), and users have to suffer from the inconvenience.</p><p>The fact that they can offer their own services (Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple TV+) <em>without</em> the inconvenience and without giving away any profit is <em>clearly</em> an antitrust issue and I’m hoping that the EC is slapping them with a big fine. Apple needs to stop their crap.</p><p>The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay">provides more information about the investigation into Apple Pay</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Apple has limited access to the Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality of its iPhone and Apple Watch devices, a move that means banks and other financial service providers can’t offer NFC payments through their own apps.</p></blockquote><p>I see the point, but I’d honestly prefer to use Apple Pay instead of the usually pretty meh apps from banks. My debit card doesn’t support Apple Pay yet (and I rarely pay with my credit card which <em>does</em> support it). Their app isn’t exactly crap, but it’s not good either. Just a solid <em>meh</em>.</p><p>However if the EC rules that they have to open that functionality and my bank then implements NFC payments within their own app, I’m not gonna complain.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The excellent Accidental Tech Podcast has launched <a href="https://atp.fm/join">a membership program</a>. For $8/Month you can get access to their ad-free feed (and likely more to come!). While it seems a tad on the high end on first place, keep it mind that you’re getting roughly audiobook-length (8-ish hours) podcasts per month. They’re also making a very good show too!</p><p>The irony of this is, that of all the podcasts I listen to ATP is somewhere at the top of having enjoyable ads. They have <em>generally</em> good and interesting sponsors, the ad reads are fun and non-intrusive (unlike these super annoying dynamically inserted ones). ATP also has a very good ad-to-content ratio.</p><p>Even better, most of the podcasts I listen to which have more annoying ad reads either don’t provide an ad-free feed at all (if there’s a Patreon or similar it usually just provides extra content and other stuff) or are not made well enough for me to support them (show notes not being filled in, etc).</p><p>I suggest to go ahead and support ATP in their decision!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First of all: WWDC is in two weeks, so we’ll then see if that’s true or not. Rumors about Apple transitioning to ARM have been going on for a while now.</p><p>I personally would <em>love</em> a well done transition. But only if it includes support for AMD64 for a few more years. They <em>just</em> dropped support for 32-bit Applications in Catalina, so I guess they’re not completely dropping AMD64 soon. Their past processor architecture transitions have been pretty smooth, so I have some faith.</p><p>Apple has been unhappy with their Intel chips for a while now, and I think that hey haven’t switched to AMD yet is a sign that they’re actually working in custom Mac chips.</p><p>I will be staying clear of the first generation ones, but my current Laptop is due to being replaced during the next 2-3 years. I hope all major issues have died until then.</p><p>Dave Mark, writing for The Loop has posted a <a href="https://www.loopinsight.com/2020/06/10/a-few-good-reads-and-one-video-on-apple-and-arm-based-macs/">very good list</a>, collecting the thoughts of John Gruber, David Shayer, and Dieter Bohn</p>]]></content:encoded>

The amount of guesswork is pretty high in this paper:</p><blockquote><p>We have limited data about anything but the uppermost layers of Saturn’s atmosphere, and there are lots of physical properties that could be tweaked in search of a perfect match. But for now, this study presents one possible configuration of the model, described as a “proof of concept.”</p></blockquote><p>But nonetheless, I’m happy to see that they’re working on it and started making theories.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, Instagram provides an API to embed posts on it. They also have a license to all their users photos. They specifically even gave themselves the rights to sub-license these to other users. Yet, they <em>don't</em> actually grant the rights to those embedding their posts.</p><p>This is <em>precisely</em> why we need an open Internet. The current social media platforms all do their best to keep users within their own ecosystem, without access from outside. Ever tried to follow a Facebook page without an account? Or a Twitter user? Or someone Instagram? The tech exists. RSS would do fine for these (in fact, I’m using <a href="https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge">RSS Bridge</a> to do exactly that), but more modern alternatives exist such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a>.</p><p>Both Twitter and Reddit are also closing down on their API, allowing certain features to be accessed only from their official client. Despite much better and more polished ones existing for both. Facebook has done so a long time ago already. You used to be able to do all sorts of fun shenanigans with it. Tom Scott has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxV14h0kFs0">a fantastic video about that</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

AMC is dying, and Disney now has Disney+ and <em>could</em> just release the bulk of it's movies there. "Trolls World Tour" was a raging success and "Artemis Fowl" is going to be released exclusively on Disney+ too.</p><p>However, Time-Warner are cutting into Disney's profit (not that Disney isn't still making truckloads of money though) there:</p><blockquote><p>So Disney needs big screens, especially since its Plan B, streaming media through Disney+, is being demolished by Time-Warner/AT&T;, which is using Trump FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's obliteration of Net Neutrality to upcharge customers who choose Disney+ over HBO Max.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>
