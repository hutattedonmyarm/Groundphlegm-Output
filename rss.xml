            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Redirect tracking goes around Firefox’s built-in third-party cookie-blocking policy by passing you through the tracker’s site before landing on your desired website. This enables them to see where you came from and where you are going.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>ETP 2.0 protects you from an advanced tracking technique called redirect tracking, also known as bounce tracking. We will be rolling out ETP 2.0 over the next couple of weeks.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>ETP 2.0 clears cookies and site data from tracking sites every 24 hours.</p></blockquote><p>This is good for users. Just one more reason to use Firefox!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>After more investigation, I found out that the distribution certificates were revoked – evidently by Apple as no one else has access to them and I was sound asleep when all this happened. […] When Apple revokes the certificate, it’s generally a remove kill-switch for the apps.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Anyway, there is (to my knowledge) no hotline for developers that you can call. As it was 7AM (all times are CET), Apple’s contact form only showed the option to send them an email – so I did. At 9AM with my teeth grinding, I went for the phone option where you leave a number and they call you back. Didn’t.</p></blockquote><p>This is the issue here. Mistakes happen.. However for something like revoking the certificate they should not only make damn sure that this is what they want to do (which clearly didn’t happen hear), but also <em>provide a good way to contact them</em></p><blockquote><p>after almost 24 hours after 10PM, I got my account re-instated</p></blockquote><p>That is too long.</p><blockquote><p>Apple has called and apologized for the complications. The issue was caused by my account being erroneously flagged by automated processes</p></blockquote><p><strong>Don’t the manually check the output of their automated process‽</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks NYT for the rather clunky title. But it <em>does</em> summarise pretty well what happened, so I’ll excuse it. In short: SpaceX launched Crew Dragon with Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley into orbit (would’ve been nice to have at least one female astronaut in there… <em>*</em>), they remained 64 days aboard the ISS, and now returned back into the blue of the blue planet.</p><p>Behnken and Hurley helped the sole Christopher J. Cassidy on it with the chores, did four space walks, operated the robot arm, and contributed to some experiments.</p><p class="footnote"><em>*</em>I get it, they’re Bob & Doug. Very good friends, both space veterans and generally a very solid choice. However it does leave a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. Also, I need to dig into how to do footnotes, Ink (the Markdown parser used by Publish) doesn’t do the <code>[^1]</code> style</p>]]></content:encoded>

Well, we got our first arrests!</p><blockquote><p>Early on July 31st, the FBI, IRS, US Secret Service, and Florida law enforcement placed [a] 17-year-old Graham […] Florida [resident], under arrest. He’s accused of being the “mastermind” behind the biggest security and privacy breach in Twitter’s history</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[…] he allegedly convinced a Twitter employee that he worked in the Twitter IT department and tricked that employee into giving him the credentials.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[…] [he] is currently in jail and being charged with over 30 felony counts, including organized fraud, communications fraud, identity theft, and hacking</p></blockquote><p>A 22-year-old hacked called “Rolex” and 19-year-old “Chaewon” were also arrested.</p><p>These two managed to ID themselves with their real driver’s licenses to Binance and Coinbase where some of the stolen Bitcoin ended up.</p><blockquote><p>[Rolex] is facing five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for one count of computer intrusion. [Chaewon] is being charged with computer intrusion, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy, the most serious of which comes with a 20-year sentence and a $250,000 fine in the US.</p></blockquote><p>Make sure to also take a look at Twitter’s <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html">blog post</a> about the incident!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yuki Morono and his team at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology dug up 100 million year old mud from the sea and fed it (Well, not the mud itself, but whatever is hanging out in there).</p><blockquote><p>They grabbed plugs of sediment up to about 70 meters below the seafloor. Very little sediment accumulates here, so that 70-meter-thick pile of clay represents about 100 million years of time.</p></blockquote><p>In case you’re wondering if it can’t just be younger bacteria in the mud, there’s an answer:</p><blockquote><p>The thing is, the researchers don’t think this is just modern bacteria that have made their way deep into the mud. In fact, they shouldn’t be able to move at all in that mud. The average space between particles in the clay should be considerably smaller than the size of a bacterium. The presence of microbes in the oldest sediments represent communities that are about as old as the sediment itself, the researchers conclude.</p></blockquote><p>But back to feeding the mud:</p><blockquote><p>The researchers took these little plugs of sediment and injected substances bacteria can use to grow, like sugar and ammonia. And sure enough, bacteria grew and gobbled them up</p></blockquote><p>In conclusion:</p><blockquote><p>So if the researchers are right about what they’ve found, it’s a testament to the fact that life is nothing if not persistent. By slowing down to live within extremely limited means, these bacterial communities may have survived for a simply incredible length of time.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been fascinated by SETI for quite a while now, so whenever I stumble over a link with info about it I tend to inhale it. Maybe, partly, because it’s so ridiculous. Who knows.</p><p>Anyways, let’s get to the sciency bits!</p><blockquote><p>You may have heard of searching for life on other planets by looking for “biosignatures”—molecules or phenomena that would only occur or persist if life were present.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To detect spectroscopic biosignatures we will need telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) or the ground-based Extremely Large Telescope, both currently under construction.</p></blockquote><p>JWST is currently facing delays (again) though. Also, do yourself a favour and check out <a href="https://www.popsci.com/craziest-names-weve-given-important-scientific-devices/">telescope names</a>, there are some nice ones! There’s (of course!) even a <a href="https://xkcd.com/1294/">relevant XKCD</a></p><blockquote><p>[…]It would be most promising to look for radio waves because they are less likely to be absorbed by planetary atmospheres and require less energy to transmit.[…]</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>What’s special about these signals is that they exhibit high degrees of coherence, meaning there is a large amount of electromagnetic energy in just one frequency or a very small instance of time—not something nature typically does.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In March 2019, Pennsylvania State University announced the new Penn State Extraterrestrial Intelligence Center (PSETI)—to be led by Wright, who is a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the school. One of just two astrobiology PhD programs in the world (the other is at UCLA), PSETI plans on hosting the first Penn State SETI Symposium in June 2021.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Some of PSETI’s main goals are to permanently fund SETI research worldwide, train the next generation of SETI practitioners, and support and foster a worldwide SETI community.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Wright often calls SETI low-hanging fruit. “This field has been starved of resources for so long that there is still a ton of work to do that could have been done decades ago,” says Wright. “We can very quickly make a lot of progress in this field without a lot of effort.”</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

I <em>know</em> it’s not easy to moderate these enormous amounts of content. But YouTube is doing such an incredibly shitty job, with videos getting demonetized for the most ridiculous of reasons, wrongful DMCA takedowns, radicalising and conspiracy rabbit holes <strong>and don’t even have a decent way for content creators to complain</strong>, that <em>something</em> needs to be done!</p>]]></content:encoded>

They current API <strong>doesn’t let you retrieve the replies to a Tweet</strong>, so showing a conversation is practically impossible. (I’m aware that there are workarounds, e.g. by using the search and then some filtering, but that’s limited by the API too), doesn’t let you access polls (not even <em>that</em> a tweet does have a poll), so it seriously limits third party apps. As a happy user of Tweetbot I very much welcome this change. I’ll just hope that they will stop bullshitting developers, Twitter burned some serious bridges there.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I agree with some of his sentiments:</p><blockquote><p>Feel free to file Google’s release this week of an update to their iPad Gmail app with support for split-screen multitasking under “better late than never”, but this is so late it borders on the absurd. It’s like the difference between showing up fashionably late and showing up a week after the party.</p></blockquote><p>[…]</p><blockquote><p>And an email client is near the top of the list of the type of apps where someone would want to use split-screen. Five years.</p></blockquote><p>However, look at this:</p><blockquote><p>I’d like to see all the vim, vigor, and vigilance Apple applies to making sure no app on the App Store is making a dime without Apple getting three cents applied instead to making sure there aren’t any scams or ripoffs, and that popular apps support good-citizen-of-the-platform features within a reasonable amount of time after those features are introduced in the OS.</p></blockquote><p>I’m all for Apple throwing out scams, ripoffs, and maybe even yet another shitty micro-transaction-riddled “game” <em>targeted at kids</em>.</p><p>But throwing them out for not using features? <strong>This sounds like hell</strong> It sounds <em>exactly</em> like the draconian ruleset the App Store is (sometimes rightfully!) called out to be. We don’t need to throw out apps just because they don’t implement a <em>convenience</em> feature. It’s not even about privacy or security, just convenience for the user.</p><p>Do I wish that more apps would adopt some feature more quickly? Yes! Do I shake my head at people using the Gmail app for their Gmail account, because they don’t think about alternatives or just configure their account with whatever app they want. <em>Absolutely!</em> But kicking an app out, because it’s not as convenient as others? Ugh. No. No, no, no!</p><blockquote><p>Video app that doesn’t support picture-in-picture? You’re out of the store. App doesn’t support dynamic type size but clearly should? You’re out. Poor accessibility support? Out. Popular email client that doesn’t support split screen? Out.</p></blockquote><p><em>Runs away screaming</em></p><p>I think Apple should do more to incentivise good iOS (and iPadOS and macOS) citizens, and nice behaviour, but <em>forcing</em> them‽</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m linking to the archive version, because I don’t want to link to Facebook directly since I despise that company.</p><blockquote><p>Last week we made a server-side code change that triggered crashes for some iOS apps using the Facebook SDK.</p></blockquote><p>This has happened <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200714081114/https://developers.facebook.com/status/issues/551281292461657/">in May this year</a> already.</p><p>They updated some server-side code, causing some versions of the SDK to crash the app during the app launch. The worst part about it is, that you didn’t even need to load or call any functions in the SDK, because it uses all sorts of shenanigans to ensure its launch together with the app. Merely including the files was enough.</p><p>On one hand, I hope this will cause more and more developers to stop using it and reduce their dependency on other code. The SDK has a plethora of privacy issues too, some can be turned off (but are enabled by default!). On the other hand, Facebook <em>requires</em> you to use their SDK if you want to provide a social “Login with Facebook” button and it’s pretty difficult to tell your customers that they need to either connect their account with another social login or with a regular email/password combination and a slow process to phase that out.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description>Thunderbolt 4 details are out. No extra bandwidth, but a few other goodies</description>

            <pubDate>Thu, 9 Jul 2020 08:11:00 +0200</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The minimum speed requirements is unsurprisingly still at 40 Gb/s, which is still a lot, instead they raised some of the other bars:</p><blockquote>
<ul>
<li> Double the minimum video and data requirements of Thunderbolt 3.<ul>
  <li> Video: Support for two 4K displays or one 8K display.
  <li> Data: PCIe at 32 Gbps for storage speeds up to 3,000 MBps.</ul>
<li> Support for docks with up to four Thunderbolt 4 ports.
<li> PC charging on at least one computer port.
<li> Wake your computer from sleep by touching the keyboard or mouse when connected to a Thunderbolt dock.
<li> Required Intel VT-d-based direct memory access (DMA) protection that helps prevent physical DMA attacks. (Read more in the Thunderbolt Security Brief.)
</ul>
</blockquote><p>There’s a comparison image in the article which I won’t include, because it sounds <em>very</em> marketing-y.</p><p>TB4 cables can now be 2m in length and enjoy the full bandwidth of 40 Gb/s, plus we can now get docks with up to <em>4</em> TB ports!</p><p>It also requires DMA (Direct Memory Access) protection, which on one hand is a good thing (there were a few attacks using TB3 and DMA in the past), but that sadly also lowers adoption rate and makes it more difficult to adopt (and costly too, because you’ll likely need either an Intel CPU or an extra chip for that)</p><p>Hey, I can’t wait for <em>even more</em> confusion around USB and Thunderbolt. Confusion around USB has been up a lot since they started renaming their old standards every time a new one came out (looking at you USB 3.1 and 3.2), shot up with USB-C (that’s only the connector and has not much to do with the underlying USB version number) where it started to get really tough to tell which cable and thing is supporting which USB-C feature and how compliant it is. <em>Then</em> it got bad, because TB3 and USB-C share the same connector. Now to add to the confusion we have TB4.</p><p>Enough about that though. Intel is planning to ship corresponding chips later this year. Apple has been pretty quiet about Thunderbolt in their ARM Macs, so we’ll see if they include TB ports, which version, and which USB version they’re going with</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>(Researchers originally dubbed it EvilQuest until they discovered the Steam game series of the same name.)</p></blockquote><p>I’d be interested to know how that has affected their sales!</p><blockquote><p>In addition to ransomware, ThiefQuest has a whole other set of spyware capabilities that allow it to exfiltrate files from an infected computer, search the system for passwords and cryptocurrency wallet data, and run a robust keylogger to grab passwords, credit card numbers, or other financial information as a user types it in. The spyware component also lurks persistently as a backdoor on infected devices, meaning it sticks around even after a computer reboots, and could be used as a launchpad for additional, or "second stage," attacks. Given that ransomware is so rare on Macs to begin with, this one-two punch is especially noteworthy.</p></blockquote><p>That hurts. Be safe people!</p><blockquote><p>Though ThiefQuest is packed with menacing features, it's unlikely to infect your Mac anytime soon unless you download pirated, unvetted software.</p></blockquote><p>Well, torrenting does have a reputation for being filled with malware, looks like it’s not going to change any time soon.</p><blockquote><p>For your Mac to become infected, you would need to torrent a compromised installer and then dismiss a series of warnings from Apple in order to run it.</p></blockquote><p>You know, I despise how much macOS and iOS in recent years have started plastering the user with warning and password dialogs. It’s perfectly normal to have to re-enter your AppleID password after opening <s>iTunes</s> Music or <s>I</s>Books after a while. And <em>this</em> is the reason what that’s bad. People get used to ignore warnings and start blindly inputting their passwords when prompted</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Last week, three years of arguing with industry finally paid off, as the European standard EN45554 was published. […] In plain English, it’s a standard for measuring how easy it is to repair stuff. It’s also a huge milestone for the fight for fair repair.</p></blockquote><p>The defined categories are as follows:</p><a href="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2020/02/28065229/Bildschirmfoto-2020-02-28-um-15.52.10.png"><img src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2020/02/28065229/Bildschirmfoto-2020-02-28-um-15.52.10.png" alt="Repairability Categories"></a><p>This will obviously depend a lot on the definition of “feasible”.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Apple will [...] create additional channels for developers to share feedback during new developer forums that will occur throughout the coming year.</p></blockquote><p>This is a small step forward. We don't know yet how they will incorporate this feedback, so I'm reluctant to get my hopes up. But it's better than <em>nothing</em>.</p><blockquote><p>Additionally, two changes are coming to the app review process and will be implemented this summer. First, developers will not only be able to appeal decisions about whether an app violates a given guideline of the App Store Review Guidelines, but will also have a mechanism to challenge the guideline itself.</p></blockquote><p>Good news! Again, no clue how much this will matter in the end, but it's a <em>start</em>. Especially the point about appealing the rules themselves could be huge!</p><blockquote><p>Second, for apps that are already on the App Store, bug fixes will no longer be delayed over guideline violations except for those related to legal issues. Developers will instead be able to address the issue in their next submission.</p></blockquote><p>More good news, should've been like this from the very beginning. Obviously, Apple sometimes forces a new submission, e.g. when they require some changes (must support 64 bit, must use new privacy APIs, etc), so you can't keep going around this by <em>only</em> providing bug-fix updates.</p><p>Speacking of which, I'm super curious how apps will be handled which <em>always</em> put "bug fixes and improvements" into their apps and automatically release a new version every few days.</p><p>Soem of them don't do feature updates, because these get slowly rolled out via A/B tests instead of a big update every now and then</p>]]></content:encoded>
