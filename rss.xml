            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I made a thing! As teased, a new post about one of the things I had in mind I wanted to talk about.</p><p><a href="https://hutattedonmyarm.github.io/Plotquisition/">The Plotquisition</a> is an episode viewer for the gaming podcast <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jimquisition">The Podqusition</a>. The hosts talk about the games they mentioned and have recently<em>-ish</em> started adding the name of the games they mention in the show notes, even including timestamps. Oh, and they do so in the same format every time, perfect for automated parsing!</p><p>My main motivation was that it's not exactly easy to find out which episodes mentioned a specific game. Sure, you could go to their Soundcloud and look at every episode's description, but that takes up so much time!</p><p>The Plotquisition essentially parses every episode and lists the games and their timestamps. They even link to the specific time!</p><p>From a technical standpoint it's pretty simple. It's a python script which loads the RSS feed from Soundcloud, parses the description of the episodes (excluding his other Podcasts such as Boston's Favorite Son) to extract the games list, correct episode cover image, etc. It then builds the HTML (not even a template and replace, just building it up) and writes it to the index.html</p><p>This makes it super convenient to be hosted by Github pages. It's just a Github action which runs via cron a couple times on Thursdays (the day a new episode drops) which runs the script, sets the date created for the badge and commits the new index.html.</p><p>If you're curious <a href="https://github.com/hutattedonmyarm/Plotquisition/">check out the source code</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Mass Effect</title>
            <description>I started playing Mass Effect LE. Lots to like, but EA isn't making this easy for me</description>
            <link>https://groundphlegm.wedro.online/posts/2021-05-25_Still_Alive</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2021 12:54:00 +0200</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Contrary to popular believe, I'm <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6ljFaKRTrI">Still Alive</a>.</p><p>I do have a few things I want to talk about and I might get around to writing them down during the next week or so, yay! None of them are the "look at this cool thing I found" type of post I initially wanted to have this for instead of annoying my friends, but such is life!</p><p>Anyways, Mass Effect. I've been wanting to play the series for a long time, it always sounded like something right up my alley, but I never actually played it. So, with the Legendary Edition coming up I wanted to take this chance. I bought it on Steam a couple days after release. and oh boy.</p><p><strong>ACT 1: Installing</strong></p><p>Just kidding, not gonna turn this into a video essay! So I started downloading the trilogy (a bit over 100GB according to Steam), and after a couple hours (we have a 50 MBit connection and in reality we usually get somewhere around half of that) I had reached 99%-ish. I wasn't staring at the progress bar, so the next time I took a look at it it was back to around 2-3%-ish. This time, the total was 93GB.</p><p>Did that fucker just start downloading an enormous patch, days after the release? Oh well, wait for a few more hours! Off to a bad start, but large patches for new games is fairly common, so oh well.</p><p>So, I finally was able to launch ME:LE. Of course, it insisted to install Origin, despite me having EA Desktop. Apparently, that won't cut it though. Installation is done, I'm <em>finally</em> clicking <code>Play</code>. The button transforms to show the game's status as running, but a second later it switches back to <code>Play</code>. Nothing happened. Seriously‽ I mash the button again, same thing. Staring at my monitor dumbfoundedly for a few seconds didn't help much. I realize that I could just open Task Manager and check what's up a tad too late, suddenly Origin pops open. Steam just didn't include Origin launching for the first time in its state. Fair enough.</p><p>Logging into Origin, finally launching the actual game. Even without needing to login to Origin, this process is pretty ridiculous. Steam launches Origin, which launches the ME:LE launcher. That one launches in fullscreen. Now, because of how my monitor and Windows HDR work the following happens: First, my monitor turns black for a second or two while switching to HDR, because the launcher provides HDR output. Then the ME:LE launcher starts with an unskippable (seriously‽) intro. From there I can launch ME:1. Now ME:1 displays a tiny splashscreen window, which is <em>not</em> HDR, so my monitor turns black again. Now ME:1 starts up in fullscreen, providing HDR output again, so another black monitor. Now, I'm actually in ME:1s main menu.</p><p>Having my monitor turn black while switching modes always happens and while annoying (especially because my monitor takes a lot longer to switch between <em>anything</em> than I'd like) is no big issue. However switching back and forth between HDR and regular SDR content during launch is specific to ME:LE.</p><p>I'm not going to say much about the game itself - I'm here to yell about launching it, not playing it!</p><p>Well, a day later I intend to play again. Turns out to be a bad idea. I'm starting with another 11GB patch. I'm not seriously complaining about that, but it <em>did</em> feel like a "of course I can't just jump in" type of issue <em>again</em>. A short while later, Steam is done and I hit <code>Play</code>. Origin isn't in the mood and tells me "[…]Origin and EA Desktop can't operate at the same time[…]". Begrudgingly I turn to my taskbar and, well, EA Desktop is not there. Task Manager provides the solution: A background process for EA Desktop is running. I kill it and try again. Same error. Huh. Restarting Steam, EA Desktop (and then killing it again) and my computer did not help either. I try to manually start Origin, so I fire up the Windows Start Menu, and I obviously can't find it there. Great. I wish the obvious had occurred to me then (that is, looking in the <code>Program Files</code> and <code>Program Files (x86)</code> folders), instead I launch the game using Steam, grab Task Manager and let that show me the location of the executable. Not an easy task mind you, the pesky origin.exe vanished after about a second or two. I manage to get a hold of it though and manually start Origin. It prompts me with an login window.</p><p>Now I'm getting mad. I'm <em>fairly</em> certain I ticked that "stay logged in" checkbox during the first start, but who knows. However, it's throwing me a completely unrelated error message at my face, confusing me about what's going and providing me with (in this case) unhelpful steps to take. Oh well, I login, make sure I tell it that I do indeed want to stay logged in. I manage to boot up the game again!</p><p>Another day passes, I try to launch ME from Steam. Guess What? More issues! This time though it's only Origin asking me to login again. Not terribly surprising, considering that EA Desktop also logs me out every few days despite my explicitly stated desire for it to not do that.</p><p>Now I have to be fair: After that last one I have stayed logged in for a week now and have not encountered any more launching issues!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Netflix uses DRM to keep its content "secure" (at least in theory, in reality shows on there are still available, usually even with the highest quality setting, for those willing to pirate). <s>Sometimes</s> Usually, DRM fails and prevents paying customers from accessing the content they are paying for, or degrades the experience. This is another one of these cases.</p><p>What happened? TVs with the MediaTek MT5891 chip got their Widevine level increased from level 1 (most trusted) to level 3. Essentially, this means that Netflix trusts the device less, thus it offers only a low quality stream to prevent pirates from snatching high quality rips. No one knows why this happened and it's <em>possible</em> that MediaTek can offer a firmware upgrade which resovles lets them get back to level 1 again.</p><p>In this case, they're working on fixing it (currently Full HD is back, 4K is "coming soon"), let's hope they'll keep doing tgat in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've been following Scalzi and Wheaton for a while now. Both their blogs and and their books (Wheaton's acting too), but not since 2010. So this is the first time I had heard about Clash Of The Geeks. The gist is, that Scalzi had this weird idea and commissioned a <a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50363001268_22f37a3294_b.jpg">piece of art</a></p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50363001268_22f37a3294_b.jpg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50363001268_22f37a3294_b.jpg" alt="Clash Of The Geeks cover" style="max-height: 500px;"</a>

Based on that, a few notable authors contributed with short stories, songs, poems and interviews. Patrick Rothfuss, Catherynne Valente, Rachel Swirsky, and of course Scalzi and Wheaton themselves. All of them describe their take on what the fuck is going on in that image.

It's glorious, go ahead and read it. It's free, but

> As before, there is no cost to this chapbook — it’s yours, enjoy! — but [if it inspires you to donate to a lupus-related charity](https://lubpus.org), that would be lovely.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I absolutely love the idea of smart glasses. There are some non-technical issues with them. The wearer's privacy, every one else's, and the implication that people instead of glancing at their smartphones in social situations they're now glancing at their glasses, which might interrupt and disturb these.</p><p>I also think the tech isn't quite there yet, both in terms of assistants and in terms of hardware. I'd also prefer having an image instead of just sound with these, otherwise they're just smart earbuds but without the rudeness of wearing earbuds during conversations.</p><blockquote><p>Up close, Alexa isn’t smart enough to know when you’re speaking with another human, so sometimes it interrupted with its random chirps.</p></blockquote><p>With smart watches and phones going more and more in the "always listening, waiting for a keyword" direction this will get better I think.</p><blockquote><p>My bigger technical problem has been keeping them running. The Frames battery has never really made it through the day — they conk out after three hours of constant music streaming at 60 percent volume.</p></blockquote><p>To be fair, I wouldn't <em>want</em> to use them to stream lots of music, due to their sound. So who knows how good the regular use battery life is.</p><p>All in all, I'm super curious how this sort of tech will develop within the next 5-10 years</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had been following the VR Headset market for a few years, and been in the “I’m going to buy one sooner or later” market. When Facebook bought Oculus in 2014, I continues to keep up with news about them, but clearly said I won’t be buying an Oculus headset. Because, you know, Facebook. A couple years later (that is, earlier in 2020) I acquired such a headset and completely ruled out any of their HMDs. This has turned out to be a good decision, I’m incredibly happy with the one I got and now this:</p><blockquote>
Today, we’re announcing some important updates to how people log into Oculus devices, while still keeping their VR profile. Starting in October 2020:
<ul>

<li>Everyone using an Oculus device for the first time will need to log in with a Facebook account.</li>

<li>If you’re an existing user and already have an Oculus account, you’ll have the option to log in with Facebook and merge your Oculus and Facebook accounts.</li>

<li>If you’re an existing user and choose not to merge your accounts, you can continue using your Oculus account for two years.</li>
<ul>
</blockquote><p><strong>Fucking what now?</strong> I <em>wish</em> this was surprising, but alas, I’m only surprised it has taken them so long</p>]]></content:encoded>

Removing it from the Store? Sure, go ahead. Terminating the dev account? That’s a whole new level, considering it affects macOS too and, well, the notarisation process for macOS apps is used ”for security and malware stuff only”. We are exiting “security” territory. Not. amused.</p><p>Because I’m a lazy guy, go ahead and read <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/">the stratechery post</a>, because Ben Thompson is alway worth a read</p>]]></content:encoded>

Not a good look.</p><p>Don’t use closed podcast platforms. Stick to the original, open, RSS based stuff.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year, we detected some unusual dimming of Betelgeuse. Now we know why:</p><blockquote><p>"With Hubble, we had previously observed hot convection cells on the surface of Betelgeuse and in the fall of 2019 we discovered a large amount of dense hot gas moving outwards through Betelgeuse's extended atmosphere. We think this gas cooled down millions of miles outside the star to form the dust that blocked the southern part of the star imaged in January and February," said Andrea Dupree, associate director of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian, and lead author on the study.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

MDN is a <em>fantastic</em> resource, but Mozilla is promising tat it’ll stick around:</p><blockquote><p>“MDN as a website isn’t going anywhere right now,” the spokesperson said in an email. “The team is smaller, but the site exists and isn’t going away. We will be working with partners and community members to find the right ways to move it forward given our new structure at Mozilla.”</p></blockquote><p>That doesn’t sound too promising if I’m honest. Oh, the site will continue to exist? And they’ll work with the community? Good riddance, I hope it will stay as good as it currently is.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a sad announcement. <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/mozilla-lays-off-250-employees-while-it-refocuses-on-commercial-products/">According to ZDNet</a> they'll lose a ton of revenue which would've been provided by Google in the future:</p><blockquote><p>Furthermore, Mozilla's contract with Google to include Google as the default search provider inside Firefox is set to expire later this year, and the contract has not been renewed. The Google deal has historically accounted for around 90% of all of Mozilla's revenue, and without it experts see a dim future for Mozilla past 2021.</p></blockquote><p>As a fan of <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> I didn't particularly <em>like</em> them havign Google as thwir default search engine, but I did accept it as a decent form of revenue for them.</p><p>I've seen a lot of criticism about how they should focus on Firefox and not all the other crap that's "nobody needs" and "only costs them personnel". As I see it, making a browser isn't exactly profitable, even if I'd love them to focus a lot on it.</p><p>Selling us cool stuff and using that to finance developing Firefox seems to me a better idea, which seems somewhat to be what they're aiming for:</p><blockquote><p>New focus on economics. Recognizing that the old model where everything was free has consequences, means we must explore a range of different business opportunities and alternate value exchanges.</p></blockquote><p>There's a bit more detail in the memo which is linked in their blog post:</p><blockquote><p>We are organizing a new product organization outside of Firefox that will both ship new products faster and develop new revenue streams. Our initial investments will be Pocket, Hubs, VPN,Web Assembly and security and privacy products.</p></blockquote><p>I'd <em>love</em> to see Pocket get some more love. I had been using it before their aquisition and was delighted to see Mozilla buying Pocket. And then they did nothing with it. The redesign is meh (the tile layout has room to display things I don't care about like "this article is super popular", but not to view my own tags) and their API exists, but is super crap. I'd be super willing to get Pocket premium, but there's not a single feature in there I'm interested in.</p><p>I sincerely hope that they'll be able to provide good value services to us in the future.</p><p>Oh, btw, they <a href="https://twitter.com/MichalPurzynski/status/1293220570885062657">killed entire threat management team</a>.That's gonna backfire.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Contextual ads can save media</title>
            <description>Why contextual ads are not only better for the user, but also better for the site who is running them</description>
            <link>https://groundphlegm.wedro.online/posts/2020-08-08_Contextual_ads_can_save_media</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is about behavioural ads vs contextual ones. So what are each of them?</p><blockquote><p>The mainstay of online advertising is "behavioural advertising" in which ads are placed based on dossiers of your activity and preferences that have been compiled by Big Tech giants and shadowy data-brokers.</p></blockquote><p>In contrast to contextual ads:</p><blockquote><p>That's when publishers sell off the right to advertise to you based on the subject of the article you're reading, your location (based on your IP address) and other metadata, like which browser and OS you're using.</p></blockquote><p>So, the issue (for whoever is running the ad, not the user) is the following:</p><blockquote><p>Advertising on the Washington Post is expensive. "Washington Post reader" is a valuable category unto itself: a lot of blue-chip firms will draw up marketing plans that say, "Make sure we tell Washington Post readers about this product!"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Here's the thing: the companies want to advertise to Washington Post readers, but they don't care about advertising in the Washington Post.</p></blockquote><p>For those who <em>don’t</em> get the ad bid, they still have the info that you are a WaPo reader. Now they can advertise to WaPo readers without having to advertise there! This is obviously a problem for the WaPo, because they want to sell their ad spaces, which is harder for them if firms can target the same people for cheaper somewhere else.</p><p>So why is the WaPo (and of course other publications!) still doing that?</p><blockquote><p>Data-brokers make crazy claims for how well their targeting works in "conversions" – that is, turning ads into sales.</p></blockquote><p>Doctorow found <a href="https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_38.pdf">a paper</a>, that says contextual ads are just as effective. Plus, they’re friendlier towards the user’s privacy (and thus easier to implement under GDPR)</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Redirect tracking goes around Firefox’s built-in third-party cookie-blocking policy by passing you through the tracker’s site before landing on your desired website. This enables them to see where you came from and where you are going.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>ETP 2.0 protects you from an advanced tracking technique called redirect tracking, also known as bounce tracking. We will be rolling out ETP 2.0 over the next couple of weeks.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>ETP 2.0 clears cookies and site data from tracking sites every 24 hours.</p></blockquote><p>This is good for users. Just one more reason to use Firefox!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>After more investigation, I found out that the distribution certificates were revoked – evidently by Apple as no one else has access to them and I was sound asleep when all this happened. […] When Apple revokes the certificate, it’s generally a remove kill-switch for the apps.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Anyway, there is (to my knowledge) no hotline for developers that you can call. As it was 7AM (all times are CET), Apple’s contact form only showed the option to send them an email – so I did. At 9AM with my teeth grinding, I went for the phone option where you leave a number and they call you back. Didn’t.</p></blockquote><p>This is the issue here. Mistakes happen.. However for something like revoking the certificate they should not only make damn sure that this is what they want to do (which clearly didn’t happen hear), but also <em>provide a good way to contact them</em></p><blockquote><p>after almost 24 hours after 10PM, I got my account re-instated</p></blockquote><p>That is too long.</p><blockquote><p>Apple has called and apologized for the complications. The issue was caused by my account being erroneously flagged by automated processes</p></blockquote><p><strong>Don’t the manually check the output of their automated process‽</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yuki Morono and his team at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology dug up 100 million year old mud from the sea and fed it (Well, not the mud itself, but whatever is hanging out in there).</p><blockquote><p>They grabbed plugs of sediment up to about 70 meters below the seafloor. Very little sediment accumulates here, so that 70-meter-thick pile of clay represents about 100 million years of time.</p></blockquote><p>In case you’re wondering if it can’t just be younger bacteria in the mud, there’s an answer:</p><blockquote><p>The thing is, the researchers don’t think this is just modern bacteria that have made their way deep into the mud. In fact, they shouldn’t be able to move at all in that mud. The average space between particles in the clay should be considerably smaller than the size of a bacterium. The presence of microbes in the oldest sediments represent communities that are about as old as the sediment itself, the researchers conclude.</p></blockquote><p>But back to feeding the mud:</p><blockquote><p>The researchers took these little plugs of sediment and injected substances bacteria can use to grow, like sugar and ammonia. And sure enough, bacteria grew and gobbled them up</p></blockquote><p>In conclusion:</p><blockquote><p>So if the researchers are right about what they’ve found, it’s a testament to the fact that life is nothing if not persistent. By slowing down to live within extremely limited means, these bacterial communities may have survived for a simply incredible length of time.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

Glad you asked! NASA is planning two more launches: Another rover to collect the samples plus a "Mars Ascent Vehicle” to, well, ascent the rocks. And then the second launch is a small orbiter which will dock the MAV, slap a heat shield on them and yank them into Earth’s atmosphere.</p><p>So, returning these samples back is going to be a whole lot of work and will include a bunch of begging for money, but let’s stay positiv and hopeful here!</p>]]></content:encoded>
