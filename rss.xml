            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>[…]it won't be available on Apple's ubiquitous iPhone and iPad.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The reason, an Apple spokesperson said on Thursday, is because Apple isn't able to review each game that's available through Game Pass.</p></blockquote><p>Yeah, uh, because, this is <em>clearly</em> different than streaming Netflix, Youtube, or using a web browser. Because it’s “interactive”.</p><p>Screw that.</p><p>Considering their <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/08/epic-gives-fortnite-players-discounts-for-skirting-apple-google-fees/">fight with Epic</a> about App Store related issues, and the EU currently looking into antitrust issues about that topic, I really hope that they’ll get slapped super hard.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a sad announcement. <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/mozilla-lays-off-250-employees-while-it-refocuses-on-commercial-products/">According to ZDNet</a> they'll lose a ton of revenue which would've been provided by Google in the future:</p><blockquote><p>Furthermore, Mozilla's contract with Google to include Google as the default search provider inside Firefox is set to expire later this year, and the contract has not been renewed. The Google deal has historically accounted for around 90% of all of Mozilla's revenue, and without it experts see a dim future for Mozilla past 2021.</p></blockquote><p>As a fan of <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> I didn't particularly <em>like</em> them havign Google as thwir default search engine, but I did accept it as a decent form of revenue for them.</p><p>I've seen a lot of criticism about how they should focus on Firefox and not all the other crap that's "nobody needs" and "only costs them personnel". As I see it, making a browser isn't exactly profitable, even if I'd love them to focus a lot on it.</p><p>Selling us cool stuff and using that to finance developing Firefox seems to me a better idea, which seems somewhat to be what they're aiming for:</p><blockquote><p>New focus on economics. Recognizing that the old model where everything was free has consequences, means we must explore a range of different business opportunities and alternate value exchanges.</p></blockquote><p>There's a bit more detail in the memo which is linked in their blog post:</p><blockquote><p>We are organizing a new product organization outside of Firefox that will both ship new products faster and develop new revenue streams. Our initial investments will be Pocket, Hubs, VPN,Web Assembly and security and privacy products.</p></blockquote><p>I'd <em>love</em> to see Pocket get some more love. I had been using it before their aquisition and was delighted to see Mozilla buying Pocket. And then they did nothing with it. The redesign is meh (the tile layout has room to display things I don't care about like "this article is super popular", but not to view my own tags) and their API exists, but is super crap. I'd be super willing to get Pocket premium, but there's not a single feature in there I'm interested in.</p><p>I sincerely hope that they'll be able to provide good value services to us in the future.</p><p>Oh, btw, they <a href="https://twitter.com/MichalPurzynski/status/1293220570885062657">killed entire threat management team</a>.That's gonna backfire.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Contextual ads can save media</title>
            <description>Why contextual ads are not only better for the user, but also better for the site who is running them</description>
            <link>https://groundphlegm.wedro.online/posts/2020-08-08_Contextual_ads_can_save_media</link>
            <pubDate>Sat, 8 Aug 2020 14:18:00 +0200</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is about behavioural ads vs contextual ones. So what are each of them?</p><blockquote><p>The mainstay of online advertising is "behavioural advertising" in which ads are placed based on dossiers of your activity and preferences that have been compiled by Big Tech giants and shadowy data-brokers.</p></blockquote><p>In contrast to contextual ads:</p><blockquote><p>That's when publishers sell off the right to advertise to you based on the subject of the article you're reading, your location (based on your IP address) and other metadata, like which browser and OS you're using.</p></blockquote><p>So, the issue (for whoever is running the ad, not the user) is the following:</p><blockquote><p>Advertising on the Washington Post is expensive. "Washington Post reader" is a valuable category unto itself: a lot of blue-chip firms will draw up marketing plans that say, "Make sure we tell Washington Post readers about this product!"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Here's the thing: the companies want to advertise to Washington Post readers, but they don't care about advertising in the Washington Post.</p></blockquote><p>For those who <em>don’t</em> get the ad bid, they still have the info that you are a WaPo reader. Now they can advertise to WaPo readers without having to advertise there! This is obviously a problem for the WaPo, because they want to sell their ad spaces, which is harder for them if firms can target the same people for cheaper somewhere else.</p><p>So why is the WaPo (and of course other publications!) still doing that?</p><blockquote><p>Data-brokers make crazy claims for how well their targeting works in "conversions" – that is, turning ads into sales.</p></blockquote><p>Doctorow found <a href="https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_38.pdf">a paper</a>, that says contextual ads are just as effective. Plus, they’re friendlier towards the user’s privacy (and thus easier to implement under GDPR)</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Redirect tracking goes around Firefox’s built-in third-party cookie-blocking policy by passing you through the tracker’s site before landing on your desired website. This enables them to see where you came from and where you are going.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>ETP 2.0 protects you from an advanced tracking technique called redirect tracking, also known as bounce tracking. We will be rolling out ETP 2.0 over the next couple of weeks.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>ETP 2.0 clears cookies and site data from tracking sites every 24 hours.</p></blockquote><p>This is good for users. Just one more reason to use Firefox!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>After more investigation, I found out that the distribution certificates were revoked – evidently by Apple as no one else has access to them and I was sound asleep when all this happened. […] When Apple revokes the certificate, it’s generally a remove kill-switch for the apps.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Anyway, there is (to my knowledge) no hotline for developers that you can call. As it was 7AM (all times are CET), Apple’s contact form only showed the option to send them an email – so I did. At 9AM with my teeth grinding, I went for the phone option where you leave a number and they call you back. Didn’t.</p></blockquote><p>This is the issue here. Mistakes happen.. However for something like revoking the certificate they should not only make damn sure that this is what they want to do (which clearly didn’t happen hear), but also <em>provide a good way to contact them</em></p><blockquote><p>after almost 24 hours after 10PM, I got my account re-instated</p></blockquote><p>That is too long.</p><blockquote><p>Apple has called and apologized for the complications. The issue was caused by my account being erroneously flagged by automated processes</p></blockquote><p><strong>Don’t the manually check the output of their automated process‽</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks NYT for the rather clunky title. But it <em>does</em> summarise pretty well what happened, so I’ll excuse it. In short: SpaceX launched Crew Dragon with Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley into orbit (would’ve been nice to have at least one female astronaut in there… <em>*</em>), they remained 64 days aboard the ISS, and now returned back into the blue of the blue planet.</p><p>Behnken and Hurley helped the sole Christopher J. Cassidy on it with the chores, did four space walks, operated the robot arm, and contributed to some experiments.</p><p class="footnote"><em>*</em>I get it, they’re Bob & Doug. Very good friends, both space veterans and generally a very solid choice. However it does leave a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. Also, I need to dig into how to do footnotes, Ink (the Markdown parser used by Publish) doesn’t do the <code>[^1]</code> style</p>]]></content:encoded>

Well, we got our first arrests!</p><blockquote><p>Early on July 31st, the FBI, IRS, US Secret Service, and Florida law enforcement placed [a] 17-year-old Graham […] Florida [resident], under arrest. He’s accused of being the “mastermind” behind the biggest security and privacy breach in Twitter’s history</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[…] he allegedly convinced a Twitter employee that he worked in the Twitter IT department and tricked that employee into giving him the credentials.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[…] [he] is currently in jail and being charged with over 30 felony counts, including organized fraud, communications fraud, identity theft, and hacking</p></blockquote><p>A 22-year-old hacked called “Rolex” and 19-year-old “Chaewon” were also arrested.</p><p>These two managed to ID themselves with their real driver’s licenses to Binance and Coinbase where some of the stolen Bitcoin ended up.</p><blockquote><p>[Rolex] is facing five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for one count of computer intrusion. [Chaewon] is being charged with computer intrusion, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy, the most serious of which comes with a 20-year sentence and a $250,000 fine in the US.</p></blockquote><p>Make sure to also take a look at Twitter’s <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html">blog post</a> about the incident!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yuki Morono and his team at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology dug up 100 million year old mud from the sea and fed it (Well, not the mud itself, but whatever is hanging out in there).</p><blockquote><p>They grabbed plugs of sediment up to about 70 meters below the seafloor. Very little sediment accumulates here, so that 70-meter-thick pile of clay represents about 100 million years of time.</p></blockquote><p>In case you’re wondering if it can’t just be younger bacteria in the mud, there’s an answer:</p><blockquote><p>The thing is, the researchers don’t think this is just modern bacteria that have made their way deep into the mud. In fact, they shouldn’t be able to move at all in that mud. The average space between particles in the clay should be considerably smaller than the size of a bacterium. The presence of microbes in the oldest sediments represent communities that are about as old as the sediment itself, the researchers conclude.</p></blockquote><p>But back to feeding the mud:</p><blockquote><p>The researchers took these little plugs of sediment and injected substances bacteria can use to grow, like sugar and ammonia. And sure enough, bacteria grew and gobbled them up</p></blockquote><p>In conclusion:</p><blockquote><p>So if the researchers are right about what they’ve found, it’s a testament to the fact that life is nothing if not persistent. By slowing down to live within extremely limited means, these bacterial communities may have survived for a simply incredible length of time.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been fascinated by SETI for quite a while now, so whenever I stumble over a link with info about it I tend to inhale it. Maybe, partly, because it’s so ridiculous. Who knows.</p><p>Anyways, let’s get to the sciency bits!</p><blockquote><p>You may have heard of searching for life on other planets by looking for “biosignatures”—molecules or phenomena that would only occur or persist if life were present.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To detect spectroscopic biosignatures we will need telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) or the ground-based Extremely Large Telescope, both currently under construction.</p></blockquote><p>JWST is currently facing delays (again) though. Also, do yourself a favour and check out <a href="https://www.popsci.com/craziest-names-weve-given-important-scientific-devices/">telescope names</a>, there are some nice ones! There’s (of course!) even a <a href="https://xkcd.com/1294/">relevant XKCD</a></p><blockquote><p>[…]It would be most promising to look for radio waves because they are less likely to be absorbed by planetary atmospheres and require less energy to transmit.[…]</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>What’s special about these signals is that they exhibit high degrees of coherence, meaning there is a large amount of electromagnetic energy in just one frequency or a very small instance of time—not something nature typically does.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In March 2019, Pennsylvania State University announced the new Penn State Extraterrestrial Intelligence Center (PSETI)—to be led by Wright, who is a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the school. One of just two astrobiology PhD programs in the world (the other is at UCLA), PSETI plans on hosting the first Penn State SETI Symposium in June 2021.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Some of PSETI’s main goals are to permanently fund SETI research worldwide, train the next generation of SETI practitioners, and support and foster a worldwide SETI community.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Wright often calls SETI low-hanging fruit. “This field has been starved of resources for so long that there is still a ton of work to do that could have been done decades ago,” says Wright. “We can very quickly make a lot of progress in this field without a lot of effort.”</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

I <em>know</em> it’s not easy to moderate these enormous amounts of content.

They current API <strong>doesn’t let you retrieve the replies to a Tweet</strong>, so showing a conversation is practically impossible. (I’m aware that there are workarounds, e.g. by using the search and then some filtering, but that’s limited by the API too), doesn’t let you access polls (not even <em>that</em> a tweet does have a poll), so it seriously limits third party apps. As a happy user of Tweetbot I very much welcome this change. I’ll just hope that they will stop bullshitting developers, Twitter burned some serious bridges there.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I agree with some of his sentiments:</p><blockquote><p>Feel free to file Google’s release this week of an update to their iPad Gmail app with support for split-screen multitasking under “better late than never”, but this is so late it borders on the absurd. It’s like the difference between showing up fashionably late and showing up a week after the party.</p></blockquote><p>[…]</p><blockquote><p>And an email client is near the top of the list of the type of apps where someone would want to use split-screen. Five years.</p></blockquote><p>However, look at this:</p><blockquote><p>I’d like to see all the vim, vigor, and vigilance Apple applies to making sure no app on the App Store is making a dime without Apple getting three cents applied instead to making sure there aren’t any scams or ripoffs, and that popular apps support good-citizen-of-the-platform features within a reasonable amount of time after those features are introduced in the OS.</p></blockquote><p>I’m all for Apple throwing out scams, ripoffs, and maybe even yet another shitty micro-transaction-riddled “game” <em>targeted at kids</em>.</p><p>But throwing them out for not using features? <strong>This sounds like hell</strong> It sounds <em>exactly</em> like the draconian ruleset the App Store is (sometimes rightfully!) called out to be. We don’t need to throw out apps just because they don’t implement a <em>convenience</em> feature. It’s not even about privacy or security, just convenience for the user.</p><p>Do I wish that more apps would adopt some feature more quickly? Yes! Do I shake my head at people using the Gmail app for their Gmail account, because they don’t think about alternatives or just configure their account with whatever app they want. <em>Absolutely!</em> But kicking an app out, because it’s not as convenient as others? Ugh. No. No, no, no!</p><blockquote><p>Video app that doesn’t support picture-in-picture? You’re out of the store. App doesn’t support dynamic type size but clearly should? You’re out. Poor accessibility support? Out. Popular email client that doesn’t support split screen? Out.</p></blockquote><p><em>Runs away screaming</em></p><p>I think Apple should do more to incentivise good iOS (and iPadOS and macOS) citizens, and nice behaviour, but <em>forcing</em> them‽</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m linking to the archive version, because I don’t want to link to Facebook directly since I despise that company.</p><blockquote><p>Last week we made a server-side code change that triggered crashes for some iOS apps using the Facebook SDK.</p></blockquote><p>This has happened <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200714081114/https://developers.facebook.com/status/issues/551281292461657/">in May this year</a> already.</p><p>They updated some server-side code, causing some versions of the SDK to crash the app during the app launch. The worst part about it is, that you didn’t even need to load or call any functions in the SDK, because it uses all sorts of shenanigans to ensure its launch together with the app. Merely including the files was enough.</p><p>On one hand, I hope this will cause more and more developers to stop using it and reduce their dependency on other code. The SDK has a plethora of privacy issues too, some can be turned off (but are enabled by default!). On the other hand, Facebook <em>requires</em> you to use their SDK if you want to provide a social “Login with Facebook” button and it’s pretty difficult to tell your customers that they need to either connect their account with another social login or with a regular email/password combination and a slow process to phase that out.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://groundphlegm.wedro.online/posts/2020-07-09_Thunderbolt_4</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 9 Jul 2020 08:11:00 +0200</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The minimum speed requirements is unsurprisingly still at 40 Gb/s, which is still a lot, instead they raised some of the other bars:</p><blockquote>
<ul>
<li> Double the minimum video and data requirements of Thunderbolt 3.<ul>
  <li> Video: Support for two 4K displays or one 8K display.
  <li> Data: PCIe at 32 Gbps for storage speeds up to 3,000 MBps.</ul>
<li> Support for docks with up to four Thunderbolt 4 ports.
<li> PC charging on at least one computer port.
<li> Wake your computer from sleep by touching the keyboard or mouse when connected to a Thunderbolt dock.
<li> Required Intel VT-d-based direct memory access (DMA) protection that helps prevent physical DMA attacks. (Read more in the Thunderbolt Security Brief.)
</ul>
</blockquote><p>There’s a comparison image in the article which I won’t include, because it sounds <em>very</em> marketing-y.</p><p>TB4 cables can now be 2m in length and enjoy the full bandwidth of 40 Gb/s, plus we can now get docks with up to <em>4</em> TB ports!</p><p>It also requires DMA (Direct Memory Access) protection, which on one hand is a good thing (there were a few attacks using TB3 and DMA in the past), but that sadly also lowers adoption rate and makes it more difficult to adopt (and costly too, because you’ll likely need either an Intel CPU or an extra chip for that)</p><p>Hey, I can’t wait for <em>even more</em> confusion around USB and Thunderbolt. Confusion around USB has been up a lot since they started renaming their old standards every time a new one came out (looking at you USB 3.1 and 3.2), shot up with USB-C (that’s only the connector and has not much to do with the underlying USB version number) where it started to get really tough to tell which cable and thing is supporting which USB-C feature and how compliant it is. <em>Then</em> it got bad, because TB3 and USB-C share the same connector. Now to add to the confusion we have TB4.</p><p>Enough about that though. Intel is planning to ship corresponding chips later this year. Apple has been pretty quiet about Thunderbolt in their ARM Macs, so we’ll see if they include TB ports, which version, and which USB version they’re going with</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>(Researchers originally dubbed it EvilQuest until they discovered the Steam game series of the same name.)</p></blockquote><p>I’d be interested to know how that has affected their sales!</p><blockquote><p>In addition to ransomware, ThiefQuest has a whole other set of spyware capabilities that allow it to exfiltrate files from an infected computer, search the system for passwords and cryptocurrency wallet data, and run a robust keylogger to grab passwords, credit card numbers, or other financial information as a user types it in. The spyware component also lurks persistently as a backdoor on infected devices, meaning it sticks around even after a computer reboots, and could be used as a launchpad for additional, or "second stage," attacks. Given that ransomware is so rare on Macs to begin with, this one-two punch is especially noteworthy.</p></blockquote><p>That hurts. Be safe people!</p><blockquote><p>Though ThiefQuest is packed with menacing features, it's unlikely to infect your Mac anytime soon unless you download pirated, unvetted software.</p></blockquote><p>Well, torrenting does have a reputation for being filled with malware, looks like it’s not going to change any time soon.</p><blockquote><p>For your Mac to become infected, you would need to torrent a compromised installer and then dismiss a series of warnings from Apple in order to run it.</p></blockquote><p>You know, I despise how much macOS and iOS in recent years have started plastering the user with warning and password dialogs. It’s perfectly normal to have to re-enter your AppleID password after opening <s>iTunes</s> Music or <s>I</s>Books after a while. And <em>this</em> is the reason what that’s bad. People get used to ignore warnings and start blindly inputting their passwords when prompted</p>]]></content:encoded>
