            <title>Instagram just threw users of its embedding API under the bus</title>
            <description>Instagrams declares that users embedding their content don't have the license to embed other people's content</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, Instagram provides an API to embed posts on it. They also have a license to all their users photos. They specifically even gave themselves the rights to sub-license these to other users. Yet, they <em>don't</em> actually grant the rights to those embedding their posts.</p><p>This is <em>precisely</em> why we need an open Internet. The current social media platforms all do their best to keep users within their own ecosystem, without access from outside. Ever tried to follow a Facebook page without an account? Or a Twitter user? Or someone Instagram? The tech exists. RSS would do fine for these (in fact, I’m using <a href="https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge">RSS Bridge</a> to do exactly that), but more modern alternatives exist such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a>.</p><p>Both Twitter and Reddit are also closing down on their API, allowing certain features to be accessed only from their official client. Despite much better and more polished ones existing for both. Facebook has done so a long time ago already. You used to be able to do all sorts of fun shenanigans with it. Tom Scott has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxV14h0kFs0">a fantastic video about that</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The physics kind of hologram, not the Star Trek kind. Sorry!</p><p>I generally find physics super interesting, even though I barely understand any of it. To be fair, I'm not alone, a lot more in modern physics is an enormous question mark than most people realize. We basically <a href="http://phdcomics.com/noidea/">have no idea</a> what's going on.</p><p>Quantum gravity is a complex beast; gravity turns out to be super weird in all sorts of ways and we (that is, man very very smart people) haven't figured out yet how to combine quantum theory and gravity.</p><p>This new paper is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle">holographic principle</a> (no, not the <a href="https://album.link/en/i/1458752909">Epica Album</a> although it's pretty good. Go listen to it!) and therefore based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory">String Theory</a>. That's super deep into "no fucking clue" territory.</p><p>Anyways, I still think it's a cool idea!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>AMC's bankruptcy is the first domino in monopolist collapse</title>
            <description>AMC is going bankrupt, blames the current situation. Lots of monopolies involved too.</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cory Doctorow is talking on his excellent Pluralistic blog about the collapse of AMC, and the monopolies involved in it.</p><blockquote><p>What's more, AMC took advantage of America's nonexistent antitrust law to buy most of its competitors, making it the only screen in town for many of America's cities.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>AMC's demise matters, then, because it constitutes the bulk of American screens.</p></blockquote><p>This is going to be interesting how the movie industry is going to look like in a year or two. AMC is dying, and Disney now has Disney+ and <em>could</em> just release the bulk of it's movies there. "Trolls World Tour" was a raging success and "Artemis Fowl" is going to be released exclusively on Disney+ too.</p><p>However, Time-Warner are cutting into Disney's profit (not that Disney isn't still making truckloads of money though) there:</p><blockquote><p>So Disney needs big screens, especially since its Plan B, streaming media through Disney+, is being demolished by Time-Warner/AT&T;, which is using Trump FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's obliteration of Net Neutrality to upcharge customers who choose Disney+ over HBO Max.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If nothing else, it's a good read. Go and check it out!</p><p>I certainly understand that Apple wants to prevent spamming on their platform, but I love automating stuff, so I find it's quite a shame. On one hand I'd like to have an official iMesage app on Windows (I do own a Windows machine after all), on the other hand... have you <em>seen</em> their Windows software? iTunes is even worse than its macOS counterpart was (and honestly, "Music" is still crap), and iCloud is basically non-functional for me. <em>If</em> it works it's slow, but usually it just doesn't work at all.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Initially I wanted to go towards the linklog style of content, mostly because "oh, look what I found" and a comment about it is what I do <em>anyways</em>, but obviously the first entry (and this one too!) had to be different. Whoops.</p><p>I didn't even have a decent way yet to do it the way I want (by turning the blog titles into a link to the original), but I just implemented that. There's still some things missing, it sort of works now!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, this is it. The basics are up, but I'm sure I'll be fiddling with it for a bit. Xcode's syntax highlighting for markdown is quite... <a href="https://groundphlegm.wedro.online//images/xcode-syntax-highlight.png">interesting</a>!.</p><a href="https://groundphlegm.wedro.online//images/xcode-syntax-highlight.png"><img src="https://groundphlegm.wedro.online//images/xcode-syntax-highlight.png" alt="Xcode Markdown Syntac Highligter"></a><p>For whatever reason it seems to think of it as a Swift file. Restarting it helped, so I can live with it</p>]]></content:encoded>
