            <description>The new Twitter API fixes *some* of the more annoying issues with the current one</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An unusual one, I’m not multiple days late for something!</p><p>I’m not entirely sure it needed a complete API redesign, it would’ve been enough to add the missing endpoints. They current API <strong>doesn’t let you retrieve the replies to a Tweet</strong>, so showing a conversation is practically impossible. (I’m aware that there are workarounds, e.g. by using the search and then some filtering, but that’s limited by the API too), doesn’t let you access polls (not even <em>that</em> a tweet does have a poll), so it seriously limits third party apps. As a happy user of Tweetbot I very much welcome this change. I’ll just hope that they will stop bullshitting developers, Twitter burned some serious bridges there.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2020 18:45:00 +0200</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I agree with some of his sentiments:</p><blockquote><p>Feel free to file Google’s release this week of an update to their iPad Gmail app with support for split-screen multitasking under “better late than never”, but this is so late it borders on the absurd. It’s like the difference between showing up fashionably late and showing up a week after the party.</p></blockquote><p>[…]</p><blockquote><p>And an email client is near the top of the list of the type of apps where someone would want to use split-screen. Five years.</p></blockquote><p>However, look at this:</p><blockquote><p>I’d like to see all the vim, vigor, and vigilance Apple applies to making sure no app on the App Store is making a dime without Apple getting three cents applied instead to making sure there aren’t any scams or ripoffs, and that popular apps support good-citizen-of-the-platform features within a reasonable amount of time after those features are introduced in the OS.</p></blockquote><p>I’m all for Apple throwing out scams, ripoffs, and maybe even yet another shitty micro-transaction-riddled “game” <em>targeted at kids</em>.</p><p>But throwing them out for not using features? <strong>This sounds like hell</strong> It sounds <em>exactly</em> like the draconian ruleset the App Store is (sometimes rightfully!) called out to be. We don’t need to throw out apps just because they don’t implement a <em>convenience</em> feature. It’s not even about privacy or security, just convenience for the user.</p><p>Do I wish that more apps would adopt some feature more quickly? Yes! Do I shake my head at people using the Gmail app for their Gmail account, because they don’t think about alternatives or just configure their account with whatever app they want. <em>Absolutely!</em> But kicking an app out, because it’s not as convenient as others? Ugh. No. No, no, no!</p><blockquote><p>Video app that doesn’t support picture-in-picture? You’re out of the store. App doesn’t support dynamic type size but clearly should? You’re out. Poor accessibility support? Out. Popular email client that doesn’t support split screen? Out.</p></blockquote><p><em>Runs away screaming</em></p><p>I think Apple should do more to incentivise good iOS (and iPadOS and macOS) citizens, and nice behaviour, but <em>forcing</em> them‽</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m linking to the archive version, because I don’t want to link to Facebook directly since I despise that company.</p><blockquote><p>Last week we made a server-side code change that triggered crashes for some iOS apps using the Facebook SDK.</p></blockquote><p>This has happened <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200714081114/https://developers.facebook.com/status/issues/551281292461657/">in May this year</a> already.</p><p>They updated some server-side code, causing some versions of the SDK to crash the app during the app launch. The worst part about it is, that you didn’t even need to load or call any functions in the SDK, because it uses all sorts of shenanigans to ensure its launch together with the app. Merely including the files was enough.</p><p>On one hand, I hope this will cause more and more developers to stop using it and reduce their dependency on other code. The SDK has a plethora of privacy issues too, some can be turned off (but are enabled by default!). On the other hand, Facebook <em>requires</em> you to use their SDK if you want to provide a social “Login with Facebook” button and it’s pretty difficult to tell your customers that they need to either connect their account with another social login or with a regular email/password combination and a slow process to phase that out.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Intel reveals Thunderbolt 4</title>
            <description>Thunderbolt 4 details are out. No extra bandwidth, but a few other goodies</description>
            <link>https://groundphlegm.wedro.online/posts/2020-07-09_Thunderbolt_4</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 9 Jul 2020 08:11:00 +0200</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The minimum speed requirements is unsurprisingly still at 40 Gb/s, which is still a lot, instead they raised some of the other bars:</p><blockquote>
<ul>
<li> Double the minimum video and data requirements of Thunderbolt 3.<ul>
  <li> Video: Support for two 4K displays or one 8K display.
  <li> Data: PCIe at 32 Gbps for storage speeds up to 3,000 MBps.</ul>
<li> Support for docks with up to four Thunderbolt 4 ports.
<li> PC charging on at least one computer port.
<li> Wake your computer from sleep by touching the keyboard or mouse when connected to a Thunderbolt dock.
<li> Required Intel VT-d-based direct memory access (DMA) protection that helps prevent physical DMA attacks. (Read more in the Thunderbolt Security Brief.)
</ul>
</blockquote><p>There’s a comparison image in the article which I won’t include, because it sounds <em>very</em> marketing-y.</p><p>TB4 cables can now be 2m in length and enjoy the full bandwidth of 40 Gb/s, plus we can now get docks with up to <em>4</em> TB ports!</p><p>It also requires DMA (Direct Memory Access) protection, which on one hand is a good thing (there were a few attacks using TB3 and DMA in the past), but that sadly also lowers adoption rate and makes it more difficult to adopt (and costly too, because you’ll likely need either an Intel CPU or an extra chip for that)</p><p>Hey, I can’t wait for <em>even more</em> confusion around USB and Thunderbolt. Confusion around USB has been up a lot since they started renaming their old standards every time a new one came out (looking at you USB 3.1 and 3.2), shot up with USB-C (that’s only the connector and has not much to do with the underlying USB version number) where it started to get really tough to tell which cable and thing is supporting which USB-C feature and how compliant it is. <em>Then</em> it got bad, because TB3 and USB-C share the same connector. Now to add to the confusion we have TB4.</p><p>Enough about that though. Intel is planning to ship corresponding chips later this year. Apple has been pretty quiet about Thunderbolt in their ARM Macs, so we’ll see if they include TB ports, which version, and which USB version they’re going with</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>(Researchers originally dubbed it EvilQuest until they discovered the Steam game series of the same name.)</p></blockquote><p>I’d be interested to know how that has affected their sales!</p><blockquote><p>In addition to ransomware, ThiefQuest has a whole other set of spyware capabilities that allow it to exfiltrate files from an infected computer, search the system for passwords and cryptocurrency wallet data, and run a robust keylogger to grab passwords, credit card numbers, or other financial information as a user types it in. The spyware component also lurks persistently as a backdoor on infected devices, meaning it sticks around even after a computer reboots, and could be used as a launchpad for additional, or "second stage," attacks. Given that ransomware is so rare on Macs to begin with, this one-two punch is especially noteworthy.</p></blockquote><p>That hurts. Be safe people!</p><blockquote><p>Though ThiefQuest is packed with menacing features, it's unlikely to infect your Mac anytime soon unless you download pirated, unvetted software.</p></blockquote><p>Well, torrenting does have a reputation for being filled with malware, looks like it’s not going to change any time soon.</p><blockquote><p>For your Mac to become infected, you would need to torrent a compromised installer and then dismiss a series of warnings from Apple in order to run it.</p></blockquote><p>You know, I despise how much macOS and iOS in recent years have started plastering the user with warning and password dialogs. It’s perfectly normal to have to re-enter your AppleID password after opening <s>iTunes</s> Music or <s>I</s>Books after a while. And <em>this</em> is the reason what that’s bad. People get used to ignore warnings and start blindly inputting their passwords when prompted</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Apple makes a tiny step towards developers and doesn't block guideline violations in bug-fix updates</title>
            <description>Apple updates their review policy for apps, adds feedback channel for developers</description>
            <link>https://groundphlegm.wedro.online/posts/2020-06-26_App_Store_Review_Policy_Update</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 26 Jun 2020 10:30:00 +0200</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Apple will [...] create additional channels for developers to share feedback during new developer forums that will occur throughout the coming year.</p></blockquote><p>This is a small step forward. We don't know yet how they will incorporate this feedback, so I'm reluctant to get my hopes up. But it's better than <em>nothing</em>.</p><blockquote><p>Additionally, two changes are coming to the app review process and will be implemented this summer. First, developers will not only be able to appeal decisions about whether an app violates a given guideline of the App Store Review Guidelines, but will also have a mechanism to challenge the guideline itself.</p></blockquote><p>Good news! Again, no clue how much this will matter in the end, but it's a <em>start</em>. Especially the point about appealing the rules themselves could be huge!</p><blockquote><p>Second, for apps that are already on the App Store, bug fixes will no longer be delayed over guideline violations except for those related to legal issues. Developers will instead be able to address the issue in their next submission.</p></blockquote><p>More good news, should've been like this from the very beginning. Obviously, Apple sometimes forces a new submission, e.g. when they require some changes (must support 64 bit, must use new privacy APIs, etc), so you can't keep going around this by <em>only</em> providing bug-fix updates.</p><p>Speacking of which, I'm super curious how apps will be handled which <em>always</em> put "bug fixes and improvements" into their apps and automatically release a new version every few days.</p><p>Soem of them don't do feature updates, because these get slowly rolled out via A/B tests instead of a big update every now and then</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <pubDate>Mon, 22 Jun 2020 21:15:00 +0200</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ll keep this short<em>ish</em>, I promise! It’s not going to be a rundown or even a list of all new features, just some of them.</p><h2>iOS &amp; ipadOS</h2><p>First of all: Seems pretty worrying that they didn’t talk about performance and reliability improvements, I had <em>really</em> hoped they’d do that. They also didn’t directly address which devices will get the updates. Device compatibility is nothing I care too much about <em>this</em> time, my iPad is new enough to be included in any case and my iPhone is old and broken enough to be replaces this fall. But saying which ones are included are giving hints to performance. Glancing at <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-14-preview/">the website for iOS 14</a> sheds light on the issue: Compatible with all devices which run iOS 13, that is: Anything since the iPhone 6s from 2015.</p><p><strong>Widgets</strong> look cool, they feel like a natural improvement over their currently existing versions. Different sizes too, neat! Especially the smart stacks look super cool</p><p><strong>PiP</strong> finally arrives on iPhones. Not for me, but I know people have been pushing for it, so good for them.</p><p><strong>App Library</strong> has the <em>chance</em> of being pretty nice, but I personally keep a lot of apps stuffed in folders, so I have only a single page anyways. Muscle memory helps with finding apps! So I personally have no use for <strong>hiding home screen pages</strong>, but I’m not going to complain about the ability.</p><p><strong>Siri</strong> has gained some much needed <strong>visual improvements</strong> and the <strong>on device dictation</strong> has been on my Wishlist for a while now. Especially with how slow it sometimes is. Now mention of the even much more needed reliability improvements though, so Siri is basically a sexy lamp now. (Damn, that would’ve been a nice transition to the HomeKit updates. But be patient!)</p><p>The <strong>Translate App</strong> looks useful as well, although I still think it would be awkward to do it actually in person and in public.</p><p>The <strong>Messages</strong> updates bring it closer to modern instant messaging apps with inline replies, mentions and chat pinning. Glad to have that. I’m also looking forward to some of the new Memoji styles, I’m not 100% happy with my avatar, mostly due to the available hair and beard options.</p><p><strong>Maps</strong> announcements are as depressing as always: Cool new features, but nothing where I live. Going to be <em>years</em> until I’ll see the improvements. Yay. Still, glad to see they care about Maps, it’s an actually good app! I <em>really</em> want the bike directions though, been wanting that for ages now, and falling back to using walking directions suck, because these are awful.</p><p>Nice <strong>CarPlay</strong> updates too, even though I don’t own a car. I still love the idea of CarPlay, mainly because I think that a car should live longer that the tech used in its entertainment system. Not sure how useful unlocking your car via NFC is though, if you can’t do it from far away. Might be neat with the Apple Watch.</p><p><strong>App Clips</strong> look interesting. I hope they won’t screw up data usage too much (or be useless with less than ideal mobile reception), but they’re at least trying to limit that damage by limiting them to &lt;10MB</p><p>The <strong>App Store</strong> has improved its search (I’ll believe it when I see it…) but <em>finally</em> allows family sharing for subscriptions. <em>Finally!</em></p><p>The new <strong>privacy</strong> features look nice too, like the finer grained permission for location and camera. So does the improved tracking protection (across apps) and the nutrition-label-esque privacy policy, reminding me about the <a href="https://tosdr.org">ToS; DR</a> project. Feels like a giant middle finger to some people :)</p><h2>iPadOS</h2><p>Looks in general more mac-like, especially with the <strong>sidebar</strong> and the <strong>new spotlight search</strong>. I’m digging it, make the iPad more like a regular computer please.</p><p>The new <strong>now playing screen in Music</strong> looks better than before, which is not <em>that</em> hard, to be honest.</p><p>The update to the new incoming calls notification has been long awaited too, let’s hope it’s not only on iPadOS, but finds its way onto phones too. Glad that they made it for <em>all</em> calls, including third party apps.</p><p>They briefly showed that <a href="https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1275122175784124417">you can set default mail and browser apps</a> on iPadOS now (maybe even on good old iOS too, who knows). YES! YES! YES!</p><p>The <strong>handwriting</strong> updates seem really cool, both the input and recognition. I’ll have to try it with my Logitech Crayon and hope it’s not Apple Pencil exclusive, since they only talked about that one during the keynote.</p><h2>watchOS</h2><p>Honestly, I’m super afraid that barely any of these features will make it to my Series 3. The newly added watch faces of the past have been excluded, so has the noise detection.</p><p>This year’s <strong>New faces</strong> look… eh? Not <em>that</em> great, so no loss for me. The <strong>rich complications</strong> are cool (but likely not compatible).</p><p><strong>Sleep tracking</strong> is huge, but also likely not running on anything older than a Series 4. (Despite being perfectly capable, as I’m actually using mine for that). Luckily, it sounded like the iPhone by itself can do it without the watch. Yay!</p><p><strong>Handwashing tracking</strong> made me laugh, but if it helps people continuing to be clean even after the pandemic I’m all for it. Sounds like I won’t get it either though.</p><p><strong>The new workouts</strong> (Dance, Core, and Functional strength) will probably find their way to older hardware, and I can’t wait to try the dance tracking in BeatSaber. “Fitness Games” works well, but maybe this is even better!</p><p>And I might be able to <strong>share watch faces</strong> with mine too.</p><h2>Home</h2><p>Open Sourcing HomeKit is huge, especially when working together with Google and Amazon on a new standard. The <s>sexy lamps</s> <strong>adaptive lightning</strong> is nice too, so are the new <strong>camera features</strong> like face detection and Apple TV doorbell PiP.</p><p>Speaking of Apple TV. Foundation ♥. Time for a re-read of Asimov’s books, they’re some of my favourite SciFi. (Yes, I know he’s a problematic person…)</p><h2>macOS</h2><p>Okay, where do I start? Again, no mention of speed and bug fixes. My MacBook is the oldest supported model by this release, so I’m <em>super</em> worried about performance. I don’t like that trend.</p><p>The <strong>redesign</strong>? I think it <em>looks</em> cool, but it seems like a lot that usability is suffering. Please, don’t <strong>auto-hide controls</strong> and make the <strong>window title bar a massive chonker</strong>. I hate the touchification of Windows in Windows 8 and 10 and this is not better. <em>So. Much. Whitespace.</em> My poor little 13” display is crying! Don’t “simplify” toolbars by removing crap and shoving it somewhere. Don’t screw up the text contrast and therefore accessibility. The new slider controls <em>look</em> cool, but are clearly touch controls not mouse/trackpad controls. Yikes!</p><p>At least we finally get <strong>grouped</strong> notifications, about time. Speaking about notifications and time. Whose idea was it to click on the <em>time</em> to open the Notification Center? Like, seriously? The fucking <em>time</em>‽ That totally makes sense…</p><p>Anyways, <strong>Control Center</strong> is somewhat cool.</p><p>I’m also super glad that they seem to be making Catalyst better, but I still don’t trust it until I see it behaving like a good Mac app <em>by default</em>.</p><p>At least <strong>Safari</strong> seems to have gotten some love. <strong>Web Extensions</strong> is huge, and I honestly didn’t expect them to do that, but <em>I am loving it so much!</em>. Let’s hope I won’t have to manually give every extension access to every site, and there’s an “yes, I know what I’m doing, please just let this extension have access to <em>all</em> sites” button. Apple has been woefully stingy with “I know what I’m doing” buttons though. The <strong>tracking prevention</strong> enhancements, a.k.a. privacy report is nice to have, seems similar to the same feature in Firefox. <strong>Dynamic translation</strong> could be fun, I might try it in Duolingo just to see if it works there (or if Duolingo are fucking so much around with JavaScript that it doesn’t work there, because they clearly don’t give a crap about performance or compatibility with non-webkit browsers)</p><h2>Apple Silicon</h2><p>Holy mother hell this is cool. I was pretty sceptical about the ARM transition, fearing they might lock the OS down even further. But for now it looks like they’ve made all the right choices!</p><p><strong>Universal 2</strong>, so fat binaries, are making an unsurprising comeback. But I am <em>very, very</em> glad to see Rosetta 2, especially the improvements they made. Translations at install time, the performance, and so on. The Maya and Shadow of the Tomb Raider demo looked absolutely fantastic, and my gaming rig is struggling to run SOTR well! (Ageing rig, playing in 4K, but still, it’s perfectly capable of running Borderlands 3 at 60FPS and 4K).</p><p>The A12Z chip is truly insane, I can’t wait for more advanced ones with a larger thermal budget!</p><p>Their promise to support Intel chips for “years to come” is nice, in a year or two I’ll have to decide between “get an Intel one while I still can” or “juicy ARM chips!”. We’ll see.</p><p>Worrying to me, is that they mentioned only Linux with their virtualisation efforts, and not Windows (or Bootcamp). Linux runs pretty well on ARM, Windows sort-of runs on ARM. Just, please don’t screw this up? My dream machine <em>is</em> a Mac with a powerful external GPU and dual booting into Windows for gaming. A dream I don’t want to give up just yet.</p><h2>Misc</h2><p>Neat, <strong>AirPods</strong> now do auto-device switching! I’ve been having some issues with them connecting to devices, but honestly, it might be just my iPhone’s hardware slowly failing.</p><p>Just a sidetone: Tim’s final words felt very “Tim out, <em>micdrop</em>-esque”, I loved it. Gotta be careful about telling people “can’t innovate my ass” though, it didn’t end well the last time…</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BEC laboratories (to put it super simple: Insanely powerful fridges) have been around for a few years and are a nifty tool to for researching quantum physics. However, they tend to be rather large and heavy, making them rather unsuitable to be launched into space and used on space stations. Of course, that problem has been solved, and the ISS has had a bit of time doing experiments with one, called the CAL (Cold Atom Lab).</p><blockquote><p>[...]On Earth, says Aveline, gravity will just pull the atoms in the center of the BEC cloud down to the bottom of the trap until they spill out, distorting the condensate or ruining it entirely. But in microgravity, the tools in the CAL can hold the atoms together even as the trap’s volume increases. That makes for a longer-lived condensate, which in turn allows scientists to study it longer than they could on Earth (this initial demonstration ran for 1.118 seconds, although the goal is to be able to detect the cloud for up to 10 seconds).</p></blockquote><p>This is not only super cool, but also pretty useful:<br><br>&gt; From a more practical perspective, Aveline believes the team’s work could pave the way for better inertial sensors. “The applications range from accelerometers and seismometers to gyroscopes,” he says.</p><p>Especially accelerometers are pretty much everywhere, so improving them could have all sorts of technological benefits</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Apple's Developer macOS App</title>
            <description>Apple releases their Developer app on macOS. It’s very Catalyst.</description>
            <link>https://groundphlegm.wedro.online/posts/2020-06-21_WWDC_macOS_Catalyst_App</link>
            <pubDate>Sun, 21 Jun 2020 19:55:00 +0200</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So Apple has finally released a macOS version of their WWDC app. Unsurprisingly, it’s based on Catalyst. I’m not a fan of Catalyst at all, I haven’t found a <em>good</em> app based on it yet. They range from crappy to barely acceptable. They usually don’t feel like a good Mac app and get the details wrong. And exactly these details are what make good Mac apps.</p><p>This WWDC app is no exception. It exists and it’s… okay. Nothing more, nothing less.</p><blockquote><p>When you select the search field in the Developer app it shows the focus ring. Unfortunately this focus ring has square corners, rather than the rounded corners seen on every other focus ring on the Mac.</p></blockquote><p>I’d call it nitpicky (and I promise, the other points are more important), but this is a good example, because it emphasised how deep the problem is and that even in the best case these apps feel just a bit off.</p><blockquote><p>There should be a UI element that is the current focus, upon which keyboard input or menu items act. This is displayed by using the system accent colour. […] Unfortunately the Developer app doesn't do this at all, leading to confusion as to where the focus currently is.</p></blockquote><p>I do most of my things with the keyboard, so current focus is <em>crucial</em> to me.</p><blockquote><p>When a table has focus on the Mac, users expect to be able to start typing in a word. The table will then jump selection to the cell who's content most closely matches the typed value. Sadly the Developer app does not support this (which seems to be another general Catalyst issue).</p></blockquote><p>This is another one of those small quality of life things which make my life as a user easier and just got forgotten about by Catalyst</p><blockquote><p>At the bottom is a button titled "See latest videos and articles". Rather than switching the sidebar navigation to the "What's New" section, it instead slides on the "What's New" list in the full content area</p></blockquote><p>Aaaaaaaah!</p><blockquote><p>Unfortunately the navigation when using something like VoiceOver is not great. […] Unfortunately everything seems to be at the top level. And I mean everything. Every view, every table cell. Even the find bar can be navigated to, even though it is off screen.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/06/17/developer-app-for-mac">Gruber summarised it very well</a></p><blockquote><p>As things stand right now, Catalyst seems like a framework written by people at Apple who don’t know what makes for a good Mac app, for iOS developers who don’t know what makes for a good Mac app.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

But because they <s>are a consumer and not a business product</s> are not as big as Netflix or Dropbox Apple is applying different rules here and are not allowing them in anyways.</p><p>Apple made up an argument about “Business vs. Customer”.</p><blockquote><p>First, no such distinction is made in the App Store Review Guidelines. The lone instance of “consumer” refers to the “Consumer Health Records API”.</p></blockquote><p>Oops. Apple is clearly on the wrong here, and they really need to sort their crap out when it comes to their review guidelines and especially in-App purchases.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The European Commission is investigating Apple for its App Store and Apple Pay.</p><blockquote><p>[…] over how Apple takes a 30 percent commission on every subscription signed up through its App Store in the first year, and then a 15 percent cut.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>At the same time, the companies complained, Apple has promoted its own music and books services. The European Commission is also looking at whether App Store rules stifle competition in gaming and cloud services, according to people with direct knowledge of the situation.</p></blockquote><p>Apple has made quite a lot of people unhappy with its stance on in-App purchases. On one hand it’s pushing them (and subscriptions), on the other hand they are exceptions from their Family Sharing program.</p><p>Forcing all payments for digital goods to go through their system is inconvenient for the user (can’t buy e.g. Kindle ebooks from within the Amazon app, have to through their website), because Apple wants their 30% cut and Amazon doesn’t want to give that cut away. <strong>Nobody</strong> wins. Apple doesn’t get their 30%, the other businesses (Netflix, Amazon, etc) are losing some of their customers (who are unwilling to switch to the website, because the app isn’t even allowed to <em>link</em> to the site), and users have to suffer from the inconvenience.</p><p>The fact that they can offer their own services (Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple TV+) <em>without</em> the inconvenience and without giving away any profit is <em>clearly</em> an antitrust issue and I’m hoping that the EC is slapping them with a big fine. Apple needs to stop their crap.</p><p>The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay">provides more information about the investigation into Apple Pay</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Apple has limited access to the Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality of its iPhone and Apple Watch devices, a move that means banks and other financial service providers can’t offer NFC payments through their own apps.</p></blockquote><p>I see the point, but I’d honestly prefer to use Apple Pay instead of the usually pretty meh apps from banks. My debit card doesn’t support Apple Pay yet (and I rarely pay with my credit card which <em>does</em> support it). Their app isn’t exactly crap, but it’s not good either. Just a solid <em>meh</em>.</p><p>However if the EC rules that they have to open that functionality and my bank then implements NFC payments within their own app, I’m not gonna complain.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This story is popping up again. General Electric has added DRM to their <em>fridges</em>, only allowing genuine water filters. Unsurprisingly, the GE ones are more expensive than they need to to.</p><p>I immediately had to think about Cory’s excellent <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41085118-unauthorized-bread">Unauthorized Bread</a> which he also mentions in his blog post.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Static Ad Removal: Accidental Tech Podcast launches a membership program</title>
            <description>ATP launches a membership program to lower their dependency on sponsors</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The excellent Accidental Tech Podcast has launched <a href="https://atp.fm/join">a membership program</a>. For $8/Month you can get access to their ad-free feed (and likely more to come!). While it seems a tad on the high end on first place, keep it mind that you’re getting roughly audiobook-length (8-ish hours) podcasts per month. They’re also making a very good show too!</p><p>The irony of this is, that of all the podcasts I listen to ATP is somewhere at the top of having enjoyable ads. They have <em>generally</em> good and interesting sponsors, the ad reads are fun and non-intrusive (unlike these super annoying dynamically inserted ones). ATP also has a very good ad-to-content ratio.</p><p>Even better, most of the podcasts I listen to which have more annoying ad reads either don’t provide an ad-free feed at all (if there’s a Patreon or similar it usually just provides extra content and other stuff) or are not made well enough for me to support them (show notes not being filled in, etc).</p><p>I suggest to go ahead and support ATP in their decision!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Apple plans to announce ARM transition for all Macs at WWDC 2020</title>
            <description>Rumor about Apple announcing custom ARM chips for their Mac lineup are manifesting again</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First of all: WWDC is in two weeks, so we’ll then see if that’s true or not. Rumors about Apple transitioning to ARM have been going on for a while now.</p><p>I personally would <em>love</em> a well done transition. But only if it includes support for AMD64 for a few more years. They <em>just</em> dropped support for 32-bit Applications in Catalina, so I guess they’re not completely dropping AMD64 soon. Their past processor architecture transitions have been pretty smooth, so I have some faith.</p><p>Apple has been unhappy with their Intel chips for a while now, and I think that hey haven’t switched to AMD yet is a sign that they’re actually working in custom Mac chips.</p><p>I will be staying clear of the first generation ones, but my current Laptop is due to being replaced during the next 2-3 years. I hope all major issues have died until then.</p><p>Dave Mark, writing for The Loop has posted a <a href="https://www.loopinsight.com/2020/06/10/a-few-good-reads-and-one-video-on-apple-and-arm-based-macs/">very good list</a>, collecting the thoughts of John Gruber, David Shayer, and Dieter Bohn</p>]]></content:encoded>
